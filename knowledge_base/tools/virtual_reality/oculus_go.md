Health & Safety
*These health & safety warnings are periodically updated for
accuracy and completeness. Check www.oculus.com/warnings
for the latest version.
HEALTH & SAFET Y WARNINGS:
To reduce the risk of personal injury,
discomfort or property damage, please
ensure that all users of the headset read
the warnings below carefully before using
the Oculus Go headset and controller.
Before Using the Headset
•	Read and follow all setup and operating instructions provided
with the headset.
•	Review the hardware and software recommendations for use of
the headset. Risk of discomfort may increase if recommended
hardware and software are not used.
•	Your headset and software are not designed for use with any
unauthorized device, accessory, software and/or content. Use
of an unauthorized device, accessory, software and/or content
or hacking the device, software or content may result in injury
to you or others, may cause performance issues or damage to
your system and related services.
•	To reduce the risk of discomfort, properly adjust side and
top straps, and ensure comfortable placement of the facial
interface and that you see a single, clear image; this will aid
in proper weight balance and distribution of the headset.
Re-check the settings before resuming use after a break, to
avoid any unintended changes to any adjustments.

•	Virtual reality is an immersive experience that can be intense.
Frightening, violent or anxiety provoking content can cause your
body to react as if it were real. Carefully choose your content
if you have a history of discomfort or physical symptoms when
experiencing these situations. Oculus provides comfort ratings
for some content, and you should review the comfort rating for
your content before use. (For more details on comfort ratings and
how they can assist in providing a comfortable experience, go to
https://support.oculus.com/help/oculus/918058048293446/).
If you are new to virtual reality, start with content rated
Comfortable, before trying Moderate, Intense or Unrated
content.
•	A comfortable virtual reality experience requires an unimpaired
sense of motion and balance. Do not use the headset when
you are: Tired; need sleep; under the influence of alcohol or
drugs; hung-over; have digestive problems; under emotional
stress or anxiety; or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches,
migraines, or earaches, as this can increase your susceptibility
to adverse symptoms.
•	Consult with your physician before using the headset if you
are pregnant, elderly, have pre-existing binocular vision
abnormalities or psychiatric disorders, or suffer from a heart
condition or other serious medical condition.
Seizures
Some people (about 1 in 4000) may have severe dizziness,
seizures, eye or muscle twitching or blackouts triggered by light
flashes or patterns, and this may occur while they are watching
TV, playing video games or experiencing virtual reality, even
if they have never had a seizure or blackout before or have no
history of seizures or epilepsy. Such seizures are more common
in children and young people. Anyone who experiences any of

these symptoms should discontinue use of the headset and see
a doctor. If you previously have had a seizure, loss of awareness,
or other symptom linked to an epileptic condition you should see
a doctor before using the headset.
Children
This product is not a toy and should not be used by children under
the age of 13, as the headset is not sized for children and improper
sizing can lead to discomfort or adverse health effects, and
younger children are in a critical period in visual development.
Adults should make sure children (age 13 and older) use the
headset in accordance with these health and safety warnings
including making sure the headset is used as described in the
Before Using the Headset section and the Safe Environment
section. Adults should monitor children (age 13 and older) who
are using or have used the headset for any of the symptoms
described in these health and safety warnings (including those
described under the Discomfort and Repetitive Stress Injury
sections), and should limit the time children spend using the
headset and ensure they take breaks during use. Prolonged use
should be avoided, as this could negatively impact hand-eye
coordination, balance, and multi-tasking ability. Adults should
monitor children closely during and after use of the headset for
any decrease in these abilities.
