Putting the headset on
Before putting the headset on, make sure that you've peeled off the protective film from the
lenses.
1.
Pull the headset down over your eyes.
2.
Slide the standard strap around the back of your head, and adjust them so that the
headset fits snugly and comfortably.
3.
Make sure that the cables pass through the sleeve at the back of the headset, and are
positioned straight down your back.
Adjusting the IPD on the headset
Interpupillary distance (IPD) is the distance between the centers of your eyes.
If you don't know your IPD, see How can I find my IPD? on page 10. Use this measurement as a
guide to adjust the distance between the lenses of the headset so that you'll have a better viewing
experience.
To increase the distance between the lenses, rotate the IPD knob clockwise. To decrease, rotate
the IPD knob counterclockwise.
As you adjust the IPD, you'll see a prompt indicating the current distance between the centers of
the lenses.

Why is accurate IPD important?
Accurate IPD settings help get a clear image and reduce eye strain.
The headset lenses focus images toward their optical center. This is sometimes called the "sweet
spot" in the VR industry. By adjusting the IPD knob, you can tune the sweet spot for the most
comfortable view. Misaligned IPD and improperly adjusted headsets are common causes of
blurry images, dizziness, and eye strain.
How can I find my IPD?
There are several ways to estimate your IPD.
The most accurate way to determine your IPD is to consult a professional optometrist or eye
doctor. You can also estimate your IPD by doing any of the following:
§
Use a ruler and a mirror. See below for detailed instructions.
§
Through experimentation. See below for detailed instructions.
§
Using third-party apps or websites.
Third-party apps or websites may collect personal data. HTC cannot guarantee accuracy of
third-party apps or websites in measuring IPD.
Estimating your IPD in a mirror
You can estimate your IPD with a ruler and mirror.
This method requires a millimeter ruler.
