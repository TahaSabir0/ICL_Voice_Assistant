What’s in the box
Where to use and store your vinyl Cutter
Location, Location, Location!  It’s not just important for real estate.  Where your vinyl
cutter “lives” in your home or business is a vitally important element of your success.
You need access to a 110 volt grounded electrical outlet.  That’s the standard
household kind with three holes, not two.  Be safe... don’t plug your cutter into
an already over-crowded powerstrip or system of extension cords.
Dust and dirt will limit the useful life of your cutter.  If you use it in a dusty or
dirty environment the cooling fans will suck in the dust and it will get inside
the machine and gum up the works.
Operate on a stable surface.  A solid flat surface is needed for your vinyl cutter
to do its best work.  If it wobbles or vibrates during operation your cut is not
going to be as sharp and clean as it could be.
Access is important.  This is a large machine, but it doesn’t belong in the corner
during use.  You’ll need to access the front and back of the cutter to operate it
and change the vinyl rolls.

Assembling the stand
Before you begin:
Read the assembly instructions from
beginning to end.  Give yourself plenty
of time.  Gather the tools you’ll need that
aren’t inluded in the box:

1.  6mm Allen Wrench

2.  Pliers, or a Crescent Wrench
Here’s how to assemble the stand:
Step 1.
Attach the feet (E) to the legs (F).
Attach the feet to the legs with 4 bolt sets
(2 sets per leg).  If they aren’t already
installed, screw in the rubber spacers
to the bottom of each ends of the feet.
Assembling the stand
The middle indentation of the leg should be
facing in.  The two outside indentations are
where we will attatch the crosspieces.

Step 2.
Attach the lower crossbrace to the leg (F)
using 2 bolt sets. Next, attach the upper
crosspiece
(B) and
media
roller
bracket
(D) to
the inner
and outer
portion of
the leg using these three bolts here.
Step 3.
Now, let’s mount the other leg assembly
by connecting the bottom crosspiece to the
adjascent holes and “floating” the upper
crossbrace in the adjascent slot.  Do not
attach the other side of the upper crosspiece
yet as we will need access to this portion for
the next step.
This is the foot:
This is the leg:
Notice: The
longer end
of the foot
offsets from
the side of
the leg that
has the two
highest
holes.
Longer End

The open hole is where we
will attach the catch roller
bracket in a later step.
Rubber Spacers:
Bolt Here:
Lower Crosspiece
Upper Crosspiece
Note:  The bottom crosspiece only attaches
with two bolt sets on each end despite
having four holes.  The extra holes are not
used.
Do not attach yet.

Step 5.
Install the Media Catch Roller Brackets so that the side
with the most distance from the holes is directly above
the Media Roller Brackets with the lip at the top and
facing out.
Use two bolt
sets per side
threading
one set
through the
Media Roller
Brackets,
Leg, and Top
Crosspiece.
Then set the
media catcher
poles and
basket into the rounded slots on each side.
Place the Titan Cutting module (A) on top of
the stand running the bolt threads, rubber
spacers,
and
washers
on the
bottom
of the
module
through
the holes on top of the leg mounts.  Make
sure the media rollers are on the same side
as the back of the module.  Connect using
the remaining four nuts.
Carefully set the media roller bars (H) inside
the previously installed media roller bracket,
and the uninstalled media roller bracket
while holding it next to the leg.  Run bolt
sets through the same holes of the media
roller bracket, leg, and top crosspiece as we
did on the other side with step 2 here.
Step 6.
Locate the grounding wire coming out
from behind the bottom of the left end cap.
Loosen the
bolt on the
outside of
the leg and
connect
the other
end of the
grounding
wire by
tightenning
the bolt
back
