Saturn 4 Ultra
3D Printer
User Manual

Thank you for purchasing ELEGOO brand products.
      After receiving the product, please conﬁrm whether the equipment is intact and the accessories
are complete. If there is any damage or missing, please timely contact us at 3dp@elegoo.com.(To
ensure the performance of each product, each product will undergo strict printing tests before
leaving the factory. There may be some slight scratches when you receive the product, which is
normal, please rest assured to use.)

Notice:
Please keep the 3D printer and its accessories out of the reach of children.
Please ﬁll the resin tank no less than 1/3 of its volume, but do not exceed the MAX line position.
Please place the printer in a dry environment and protect it from rain and moisture.
If you run into an emergency during use, please turn oﬀ the power supply of the 3D printer ﬁrst.
Please use the printer indoors and avoid direct sunlight and a dusty environment.
Please keep the original packaging box for 30 days for return/exchange (only ELEGOO original
packaging boxes are accepted).
If the printing fails, you need to clean the excess cured resin in the resin tank and change the
resin, otherwise, it may cause damage to your printer.
When operating the 3D printer, please wear a mask and gloves to avoid direct skin contact with
the photopolymer resin.
If the release ﬁlm in the resin tank is whitened, scratched, or has no elasticity, the printing failure
rate is high, please replace the release ﬁlm in time.
Please use 95% (or higher) ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol to wash your model unless you are
using water washable resin.
If you have any problems with the printer, please contact us at 3dp@elegoo.com.  Please do not
disassemble or modify ELEGOO 3D printers by yourself, otherwise, the warranty will expire, and
damage caused by personal operating errors need to pay for repairs.

1. Model Printing
Slowly add the resin into the resin tank (the resin level is not less than 1/3 of the tank volume and
does not exceed the MAX line. The machine will perform a self-check before printing, and do not
touch the machine during the self-check). Cover the printer's anti-UV cover and then select the
sliced test model for printing.
2. Model Processing
After printing is completed, wait until the resin on the build plate stops dripping, then lift the
handle to take out the build plate, and use a scraper to remove the model. You can use ELEGOO's
cleaning and curing machine to post-process the model.
Test Printing
After inserting the build platform into the connecting block, press down the handle to secure the
build platform to the connecting block (the build plate is capable of self-leveling and ready to use
right out of the box).
Handle

The printer can install and use the Chitu Box in the USB ﬂash drive.
1. Install Chitu Box
Select from the USB ﬂash drive or go to Chitu's oﬃcial website (www.chitubox.com) to download
the right slicing software version and install it on your computer.
2. How to Use Chitu Box
After the installation is complete, run the Chitu Box software. Click "File-Open File", then open
your 3D model ﬁle (.stl type). By left-clicking on the model and using the options on the left menu,
you can control and change the viewing angle, size, and position of the model.
Software Installation and Setup
3. Chitu Box Setting
3.1 Machine Conﬁguration Parameters
Click "Parameter Settings" and select ELEGOO Saturn 4 Ultra as your default printer. (See Picture 1)
3.2 Build Volume
You don't need to change the default parameters (See Picture 2), and X indicates the maximum
print size in the X-axis direction, and so on.
(Picture 2)
(Picture 1)
3.3 Resin Parameter (See Picture 3)
Resin Density: 1.1g/ml
Resin Cost: You can input the real price of the resin you purchased, and the slicing software can
calculate the resin costs for each model you print.

3.4 Parameters (See Picture 3)
Layer Height: The thickness of each printed layer, the recommended height is 0.05mm, but you
can set it from 0.01-0.2mm. The higher the thickness you set, the longer the exposure time will
be required for each layer.
Bottom Layer Count: The setting number of initial printing layers. If the number of bottom layers
is n, the exposure time of the ﬁrst n layers is the exposure time of the bottom layer. The default
setting is 5 layers.
Exposure Time: The exposure time for normal printing layers. The default exposure time is 2.5
seconds, and the thicker the printing layer setting is, the longer the time it will take.
Bottom Exposure Time: The setting of bottom layer exposure time. Properly increasing the bottom
exposure time can help to increase the stickiness between the printed model and the printing
platform, and the default setting is 35 seconds.
Transition Layer Count: The number of transition layers after the bottom layers for a tighter
bonding between layers.  Except for the exposure time, other parameters of the transition layers
are the same as the normal layers.
Transition Type: Set the transition type of exposure time when transitioning from bottom layers
to normal layers, the default is linear transition.
Rest Time Before Release: The time diﬀerence between the end of print exposure and the start of
printer release. The default is 0 seconds.
Rest Time After Release: After the printing platform is lifted, the time diﬀerence between the
printer starts to rest and starts to return. The default is 0 seconds.
Rest Time After Retract: The time diﬀerence between the printer starts to rest after retraction and
the start of exposure. The default is 0 seconds.
Note: The printing parameters listed in this manual are for reference only. In actual applications,
please contact the oﬃcial after-sales technical support to conﬁrm the parameters based on
comprehensive factors such as the machine model and resin (including type and color) used by
the individual.
Software Installation and Setup

Network Management Center
(Picture 4)
1. After the printer is connected to WiFi, open the slicing software and click            in the upper right
corner to enter "Network Management Center" (You need to download and install Chitu Manager
for ﬁrst time use.) (See Picture 4)

(Picture 5)
2. After entering the network management center, click "Add Device" to associate the printer
(make sure the computer and printer are in the same LAN), and the associated device can be
remotely controlled through the computer.  (See Picture 5)

3. In the printer management interface, you can turn on the camera to observe the printing
situation in real time, and you can also control the time-lapse photography function to turn on
or oﬀ.  (See Picture 6)

Machine Maintenance
Please do not use sharp or pointy tools to scrape the resin tank to avoid damaging the release
liner ﬁlm.
