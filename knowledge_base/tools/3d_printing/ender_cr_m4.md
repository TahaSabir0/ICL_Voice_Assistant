Do not use the printer any way other than described here in order to avoid personal injury or property damage.
Do not place the printer near any heat source or ﬂammable or explosive objects. We suggest placing it in a well-ventilated, low-dust environment.
Do not expose the printer to violent vibration or any unstable environment, as this may cause poor print quality.
Before using experimental or exotic ﬁlaments, we suggest using standard ﬁlaments such as ABS or PLA to calibrate and test the machine.
Do not use any other power cable except the one supplied. Always use a grounded three-prong power outlet.
Do not wear gloves or loose clothing when operating the printer. Such cloths may become tangled in the printers moving parts leading to burns, possible bodily injury, or printer damage.
When cleaning debris from the printer hotend, always use the provided tools. Do not touch the nozzle directly when heated. This can cause personal injury.
Children under 10 years old should  not use the printer without supervision.

This machine is equipped with a security protection mechanism. Do not manually move the nozzle or printing platform mechanism manually while booting
up, otherwise the device will automatically power oﬀ for safety.
Clean the printer frequently. Always turn the power oﬀ when cleaning, and wipe with a dry cloth to remove dust, adhered printing plastics or any other material oﬀ the frame,
guide rails, or wheels. Use glass cleaner or isopropyl alcohol to clean the print surface.
Users should comply with the laws and regulations of the corresponding countries and regions where the equipment is located (used), abide by professional ethics, pay attention to
safety obligations, and strictly prohibit the use of our products or equipment for any illegal purposes. Creality will not be responsible for any violators' legal liability under any circustance.
Do not touch the nozzle, hotbed or motor while the printer is in operation, otherwise you may get burned.

CHANGING THE FILAMENT
Power on the printer using the red power switch located on the left hand of the
machine
1.
The control panel is a touch screen, touch anywhere on the screen to wake it up
2.
Select the “Prepare” icon at the bottom of the screen (3 lines with dots on them)
3.
Select the “Extrude/Retract” tab at the top of the screen
4.
to remove the old filament select the “Retract Button” this will start the nozzle heating,
 once it has heated up to the proper temperature the filament will automatically star
t to retract
5.
once the filament is fully retracted you can pull it  the rest of the way out of the
 extruder
6.
Always remember to wind up the old filament and tuck the end through one of the
holes on the spool!!!!
7.
Place the new filament on the holder and thread the filament first through the
filament detector then down into the extruder
8.
Touch the “Extrude” Button and the nozzle will begin to heat up, once it has heated to
the proper temperature the filament will start to extrude
9.

PRINTER SET UP
Make sure the printer bed and nozzle are free of any debris, with the
new printers you no longer need to use glue on the bed!!!
1.
Place the USB into the slot on the side of the control panel
2.
Make sure the printer is turned on using the red power button on
the left hand side of the machine
3.
The control panel is a touch screen, touch anywhere on the screen
to wake it up
4.
Select the “File” icon at the bottom of the screen
5.
Select the “USB Drive” tab at the top of the screen
6.
Select your file from the list
7.
A screen will show your file details
8.
Select the “Print” button
9.
This will start the printing process, first the printer will auto-level the
 bed then heat up to the proper temperature after that your file wil
l start to print
10.

FILAMENT TUTORIAL:
IMPORTANT PRINTER CHANGES!
All of the printers in the lab have been upgraded!!
Glue or hairspray is no longer needed for the print bed
Bed leveling is now automatic
The beds are magnetic, to remove your print simply lift off the bed and gently flex until your print pops off
Fill out the dry erase board in front of the printer you are using with your contact info, that way if anyone is in
 the lab and notices a problem with your print they can notify you if you are in the lab and notice a print is
failing send the user an email

CREATING A 3D OBJECT
1. In order to print a 3D object you will need a 3D object file (.obj or .stl)
2. There are many open source objects online that people have already created, however you are
    strongly encouraged to try designing your own. The Autodesk suite of software is
     great for designing 3D objects
3. If you do not have any experience with 3D design I highly recommend starting with
    Tinkercad.com. Tinkercad offers free online software that is very intuitive to use and
     great for beginners

TINKERCAD TUTORIAL:
SLICING YOUR 3D OBJECT FILE
1. In order to print a 3D object you will need to “slice” your .OBJ or .STL file and turn it into a .GCODE
 2.  This is done by using a slicing program like Ultimaker Cura 3. Open Ultimaker Cura (cura can be downloaded for free at www.ultimaker.com/software 4. If it is the first time you are using Cura you will need to set up the printer:
Click Add non-network printer then select the correct printer from the drop-down list,
the majority of our printers are Creality Ender 3 V3 KE’s the large printer is the CR-M4
5. To import your file into Cura you can click either the folder icon in the top left or go to
     File>Open File
6. Select your file and it will be placed into Cura
7. With your object selected you can use any of the following 6 functions on the left side of the screen:
 Move – Allows you to reposition your object anywhere on the printing bed
Scale – Allows you to resize your object
Rotate – Allows you to rotate your object 360° on 3 axis
Mirror – Allows you to create a mirror image of your object
Mesh Type – Allows you to set the mesh type
Support Blocker – Allows you to select areas where you do not want supports
8. Using the bar on the top of the screen you can select the type of plastic you are printing
     (typically we use PLA) and the quality of the print.
9. The quality of print drop-down menu gives you options for:
Profiles – Determines the resolution of the print default=.2mm
Infill (%) - Determines how dense the interior of the object will be
       default=20
Support – Check this box to automatically add supports to your object
       (supports allow you to print objects with overhangs)
Adhesion – Check this box to add adhesion (helps object stick to base)
10. After you have the settings where you want them click on the Slice button in the bottom right corner
11. Once your file is sliced save it to a USB
