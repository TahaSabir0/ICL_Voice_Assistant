Section 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES

Inhalation
Heating may release vapors which may be irritating. In case of inhalation of decomposition products,
affected person should be moved into fresh air and kept still. Get medical advice/attention.
Skin
It is unlikely that first aid will be required. IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin
irritation occurs: Get medical advice/attention.
Eyes
It is unlikely that first aid will be required. Dust may be irritating to the eyes: Rinse cautiously with water
for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical
attention, if needed.
Ingestion
IF SWALLOWED: Rinse mouth. Get immediate medical advice/attention.
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
First aid is not expected to be necessary if material is used under ordinary conditions and as
recommended. Treat symptomatically and supportively.
Most Important Symptoms/Effects
Acute
Molten material may cause thermal burns.
Delayed
No information on significant adverse effects.
Note to Physicians
Treat symptomatically. Give artificial respiration if not breathing.
Antidote

Suitable Extinguishing Media
water, foam, regular dry chemical
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media
None known
Special Hazards Arising from the Chemical
Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient concentrations, and in the presence of an
ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard.
Hazardous Combustion Products
oxides of carbon, oxides of nitrogen, HCN, acrylonitrile, styrene monomer.
Fire Fighting Measures
Wear full protective fire fighting gear including self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for protection
against possible exposure. Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Stay
upwind and keep out of low areas.
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters
Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products. Stay upwind and keep out of low areas.

Section 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures
No measures required.
Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up
Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal. Dispose in accordance with all applicable
regulations.
Environmental Precautions
Avoid release to the environment. Comply with all applicable regulations on spill and release
reporting. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements, or confined areas.

Section 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE

Precautions for Safe Handling
Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that
dusts do not accumulate on surfaces. Dry powders can build static electricity charges when subjected to
the friction of transfer and mixing operations.
Conditions for Safe Storage, Including any Incompatibilities
None needed according to classification criteria.
Store in a cool dry place. Store below 50 C. Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of
ignition. Keep away from incompatible materials.
Incompatible Materials

4. FIRST AID MEASURES
4.1 DESCRIPTION OF FIRST AID MEASURES
Inhalation: After inhalation of decomposition products of polymer, take affected persons to fresh air. Call a doctor if necessary.
Eye contact: Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at
least 15 minutes. Get medical attention immediately.
Skin contact: After contact with hot polymer cool skin rapidly with cold water. Call a doctor if necessary.
Ingestion: Call doctor or consider to induce vomiting. Rinse mouth with water. Call a doctor if necessary.
4.2 MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS AND EFFECTS, BOTH ACUTE AND DELAYED:
Burns should be treated as thermal burns. The material will come off as healing occurs; therefore, immediate removal from the
skin is not necessary.
4.3 INDICATION OF ANY IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SPECIAL TREATMENT NEEDED
Hazards: Contact with molten substance/product may cause severe burns to skin and eyes.
Treatment: Treat symptomatically.

Section 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
Inhalation
Heating may release vapors which may be irritating. In case of inhalation of decomposition products,
affected person should be moved into fresh air and kept still. Get medical advice/attention.
Skin
It is unlikely that first aid will be required. IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin
irritation occurs: Get medical advice/attention.
Eyes
It is unlikely that first aid will be required. Dust may be irritating to the eyes: Rinse cautiously with water
for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical
attention, if needed.
Ingestion
IF SWALLOWED: Rinse mouth. Get immediate medical advice/attention.
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
First aid is not expected to be necessary if material is used under ordinary conditions and as
recommended. Treat symptomatically and supportively.
Most Important Symptoms/Effects
Acute
Molten material may cause thermal burns.
Delayed
No information on significant adverse effects.
Note to Physicians
Treat symptomatically. Give artificial respiration if not breathing.
Antidote
None known. Treat symptomatically and supportively.

Section 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Extinguishing Media
Suitable Extinguishing Media
Water, alcohol resistant foam, regular dry chemical
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media
None known
Special Hazards Arising from the Chemical
Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient concentrations, and in the presence of an
ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard.
Hazardous Combustion Products
Oxides of carbon, aldehydes. May decompose upon heating to produce corrosive and/or toxic fumes.
Fire Fighting Measures
Wear full protective fire fighting gear including self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for protection
against possible exposure. Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Stay
upwind and keep out of low areas.
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters
Avoid inhalation of material or combustion by-products. Stay upwind and keep out of low areas.
Section 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures
No measures required.
Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up
Collect spilled material in appropriate container for reuse or disposal. Dispose in accordance with all
applicable regulations.
Environmental Precautions
Avoid release to the environment. Comply with all applicable regulations on spill and release
reporting. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements, or confined areas.
Section 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for Safe Handling
Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that
dusts do not accumulate on surfaces. Dry powders can build static electricity charges when subjected to
the friction of transfer and mixing operations.
Conditions for Safe Storage, Including any Incompatibilities
None needed according to classification criteria.
Store in a cool dry place. Store below 50 C. Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of
ignition. Keep away from incompatible materials.

EU - Occupational Exposure (98/24/EC) - Binding Biological Limit Values and Health Surveillance
Measures
There are no biological limit values for any of this product's components.
ACGIH - Threshold Limit Values - Biological Exposure Indices (BEI)
There are no biological limit values for any of this product's components.
Engineering Controls
Provide local exhaust ventilation system. Ventilation should be sufficient to effectively remove and
prevent buildup of any dusts or fumes that may be generated during handling or thermal processing.
Individual Protection Measures, such as Personal Protective Equipment
Eye/face protection
None during normal use. Protect against molten solid.
Skin Protection
None during normal use. Protect against molten solid.
Respiratory Protection
No respirator is required under normal conditions of use. If respirable dusts are generated, respiratory
protection may be needed.
Glove Recommendations
Protect against molten solid. In the molten form: Wear protective gloves.
