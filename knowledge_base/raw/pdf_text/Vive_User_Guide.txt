Putting the headset on
Before putting the headset on, make sure that you've peeled off the protective film from the
lenses.
1.
Pull the headset down over your eyes.
2.
Slide the standard strap around the back of your head, and adjust them so that the
headset fits snugly and comfortably.
3.
Make sure that the cables pass through the sleeve at the back of the headset, and are
positioned straight down your back.
Adjusting the IPD on the headset
Interpupillary distance (IPD) is the distance between the centers of your eyes.
If you don't know your IPD, see How can I find my IPD? on page 10. Use this measurement as a
guide to adjust the distance between the lenses of the headset so that you'll have a better viewing
experience.
To increase the distance between the lenses, rotate the IPD knob clockwise. To decrease, rotate
the IPD knob counterclockwise.
As you adjust the IPD, you'll see a prompt indicating the current distance between the centers of
the lenses.

Headset and link box

--- Page 10 ---
Why is accurate IPD important?
Accurate IPD settings help get a clear image and reduce eye strain.
The headset lenses focus images toward their optical center. This is sometimes called the "sweet
spot" in the VR industry. By adjusting the IPD knob, you can tune the sweet spot for the most
comfortable view. Misaligned IPD and improperly adjusted headsets are common causes of
blurry images, dizziness, and eye strain.
How can I find my IPD?
There are several ways to estimate your IPD.
The most accurate way to determine your IPD is to consult a professional optometrist or eye
doctor. You can also estimate your IPD by doing any of the following:
§
Use a ruler and a mirror. See below for detailed instructions.
§
Through experimentation. See below for detailed instructions.
§
Using third-party apps or websites.
Third-party apps or websites may collect personal data. HTC cannot guarantee accuracy of
third-party apps or websites in measuring IPD.
Estimating your IPD in a mirror
You can estimate your IPD with a ruler and mirror.
This method requires a millimeter ruler.
1.
Stand directly in front of a mirror, and then hold the ruler up to your eyes. Make sure that
the ruler is level. If you're using a flexible ruler, make sure not to bend it.
2.
Align the zero mark with the center of your pupil. You may need to close your other eye to
get a clear measure.

3.
Check the millimeter mark on the other eye. You may need to close the first eye to get a
clear measure.

10 20

4.
Make a note of your IPD measurement. You may want to recheck several times to make
sure your reading is accurate.
You can also ask a friend to help you measure instead of using a mirror. Make sure you're
looking straight ahead while they measure.
Estimating your IPD through experimentation
You can estimate IPD by trying different settings. This method is very convenient, but might be
less accurate.
1.
While wearing the VR headset, focus on text or lines at the center of view. If no text is
present, open a screen in VR with text.
2.
Adjust the IPD knob until the text is clear. Note the number for future use.
3.
If the image in one eye is clearer than the other, adjust the headset position. Repeat until
images are clear for both eyes.

Can I wear my prescription glasses while using VIVE?
Most glasses fit inside the headset. If you wear large prescription glasses, adjust the lens
distance to increase the space in the headset.
Make sure that no part of your glasses scratch the headset lenses.
Adjusting the lens distance on the headset
If you wear large prescription glasses or have long eyelashes, you may need to increase the lens
distance further from your face. Only increase this distance as necessary, as the closer the lenses
are to your eyes, the better your field of view will be while wearing the headset.
Make sure that no part of your glasses scratch the headset lenses.
1.
Pull out each lens distance knob to unlock it.
2.
Rotate both lens distance knobs to adjust the lens further or closer to your face.
3.
After you're done adjusting, push each knob to lock it back in.

Installing the base stations
The hardware may be purchased separately from the Accessories tab on www.vive.com/
product/.
Before installing the base stations, decide first whether you want to set up a room-scale or
seated/standing-only play area. See Planning your play area on page 62.
During unboxing, remove the thin film that covers the front panel of the base stations.
1.
Mount the base stations diagonally at opposite corners of your space.
For details on how to use the mounting kit, see Using the mounting kit on page 51.
You can also use tripods, light stands, or cargo poles when mounting the base stations, or
even place it on stable book cases. Just avoid using unstable mounting solutions or
surfaces that are prone to vibration.
2.
Adjust the base stations so that the front panels are facing toward the center of the play
area.
3.
Attach the power cables to the base stations, and then plug them each into a power outlet
to turn them on. The status lights should be green.

Movement within a diagonal area of up to 5 m (16 ft 4 in) is supported. For example, a 3.5 m x 3.5
m (around 11 ft 5 in x 11 ft 5 in) space. For room-scale setup, a minimum play area of 2 m x 1.5 m
(6 ft 6 in x 5 ft) is required. There's no minimum for seated and standing experiences.
Can I include space occupied by furniture for the
play area?
It is not recommended to do so. When setting the boundaries of the play area, make sure that the
floor is cleared. Do not trace across space occupied by things (such as a table or a chair) since
this may cause you to trip into the object while in VR.
Will VR apps for seated/standing-only experiences work
with room-scale setup?
Even if you have a room-scale setup, you can still use VR apps that are designed for seated or
standing-only experiences. Just make sure that your headset and controllers are tracked within
the play area.
How do I resolve download errors during VIVE Setup
installation?
Download errors are usually caused by incorrect network settings. For example, due to wrong
DNS, the download server address is unresolved by the host. Some network destinations may be
inaccessible, even as connection to other websites seems normal. Please make sure that your
network settings are correct, or ask your network administrator for support.
I can't complete the room setup. What should I do?
Check if you're using special characters (such as à or é) in your local Windows user name, which
could cause the problem.
As a workaround, you can add a new Windows account using basic Latin alphabet for your user
name. After logging in with the new user name, reinstall VIVE Setup and complete the process.
