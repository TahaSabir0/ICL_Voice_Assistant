Health & Safety
*These health & safety warnings are periodically updated for
accuracy and completeness. Check www.oculus.com/warnings
for the latest version.
HEALTH & SAFET Y WARNINGS:
To reduce the risk of personal injury,
discomfort or property damage, please
ensure that all users of the headset read
the warnings below carefully before using
the Oculus Go headset and controller.
Before Using the Headset
•	Read and follow all setup and operating instructions provided
with the headset.
•	Review the hardware and software recommendations for use of
the headset. Risk of discomfort may increase if recommended
hardware and software are not used.
•	Your headset and software are not designed for use with any
unauthorized device, accessory, software and/or content. Use
of an unauthorized device, accessory, software and/or content
or hacking the device, software or content may result in injury
to you or others, may cause performance issues or damage to
your system and related services.
•	To reduce the risk of discomfort, properly adjust side and
top straps, and ensure comfortable placement of the facial
interface and that you see a single, clear image; this will aid
in proper weight balance and distribution of the headset.
Re-check the settings before resuming use after a break, to
avoid any unintended changes to any adjustments.

•	Virtual reality is an immersive experience that can be intense.
Frightening, violent or anxiety provoking content can cause your
body to react as if it were real. Carefully choose your content
if you have a history of discomfort or physical symptoms when
experiencing these situations. Oculus provides comfort ratings
for some content, and you should review the comfort rating for
your content before use. (For more details on comfort ratings and
how they can assist in providing a comfortable experience, go to
https://support.oculus.com/help/oculus/918058048293446/).
If you are new to virtual reality, start with content rated
Comfortable, before trying Moderate, Intense or Unrated
content.
•	A comfortable virtual reality experience requires an unimpaired
sense of motion and balance. Do not use the headset when
you are: Tired; need sleep; under the influence of alcohol or
drugs; hung-over; have digestive problems; under emotional
stress or anxiety; or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches,
migraines, or earaches, as this can increase your susceptibility
to adverse symptoms.
•	Consult with your physician before using the headset if you
are pregnant, elderly, have pre-existing binocular vision
abnormalities or psychiatric disorders, or suffer from a heart
condition or other serious medical condition.
Seizures
Some people (about 1 in 4000) may have severe dizziness,
seizures, eye or muscle twitching or blackouts triggered by light
flashes or patterns, and this may occur while they are watching
TV, playing video games or experiencing virtual reality, even
if they have never had a seizure or blackout before or have no
history of seizures or epilepsy. Such seizures are more common
in children and young people. Anyone who experiences any of
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine

--- Page 8 ---

these symptoms should discontinue use of the headset and see
a doctor. If you previously have had a seizure, loss of awareness,
or other symptom linked to an epileptic condition you should see
a doctor before using the headset.
Children
This product is not a toy and should not be used by children under
the age of 13, as the headset is not sized for children and improper
sizing can lead to discomfort or adverse health effects, and
younger children are in a critical period in visual development.
Adults should make sure children (age 13 and older) use the
headset in accordance with these health and safety warnings
including making sure the headset is used as described in the
Before Using the Headset section and the Safe Environment
section. Adults should monitor children (age 13 and older) who
are using or have used the headset for any of the symptoms
described in these health and safety warnings (including those
described under the Discomfort and Repetitive Stress Injury
sections), and should limit the time children spend using the
headset and ensure they take breaks during use. Prolonged use
should be avoided, as this could negatively impact hand-eye
coordination, balance, and multi-tasking ability. Adults should
monitor children closely during and after use of the headset for
any decrease in these abilities.

General Precautions
To reduce the risk of injury or discomfort you should always follow
these instructions and observe these precautions while using the
headset:
•	Use Only In A Safe Environment:
The headset produces an immersive
virtual reality experience that distracts
you from and completely blocks your
view of your actual surroundings.

f Always be aware of your surroundings before beginning use
and while using the headset. Use caution to avoid injury.

f You are responsible for creating and maintaining a safe
environment for use at all times.

f Serious injuries can occur from tripping or running into or
striking walls, furniture, other objects or people, so clear an
area for safe use before using the headset.

f Use of the headset and Oculus controllers may cause loss
of balance.

f Remember that the objects you see in the virtual environment
do not exist in the real world, so don’t sit or stand on them
or use them for support.

f Remain seated unless your game or content experience
requires standing. If you are using the headset while seated,
make sure you are seated on a secure surface and stable
platform.

f Take special care to ensure that you are not near other people,
objects, stairs or steps, ramps, sidewalk(s), balconies, open
doorways, windows, furniture, open flames (like candles
or fireplaces), ceiling fans or light fixtures, televisions or
DO
DON'T

monitors, or other items that you may impact or strike when
using—or immediately after using—the headset.

f Use of the headset with glasses may increase the risk of facial
injury if you fall or hit your face.

f While using the headset with controllers, you may extend
your arms fully out to the side or over your head, so make
sure those areas are clear.

f Remove any tripping hazards from the area before using
the headset.

f Remember that while using the headset you may be unaware
that people and pets may enter your immediate area.

f Your view of your surroundings is completely blocked while
you are using the headset, so do not hold or handle things
that are dangerous, may injure you or may be damaged.

f The headset is designed for use indoors. If used outdoors,
pay particular attention to your surroundings and make
sure you are using the headset in a safe environment away
from traffic, pedestrians or other hazards in an outdoor
environment. If used outdoors, remain seated unless your
game or content experience requires standing.

f Never wear the headset in situations that require attention,
such as walking, bicycling, or driving.
•	Ease into the use of the headset to allow your body to adjust;
use for only a few minutes at a time at first, and only increase
the amount of time using the headset gradually as you grow
accustomed to virtual reality. Looking around and using
the input device when first entering virtual reality can help
you adjust to any small differences between your real-world
movements and the resulting virtual reality experience.
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine

--- Page 11 ---
11
•	Do not use the headset while in a moving vehicle such as a
car, bus, or train, as variation in speed (velocity) or sudden
movements may increase your susceptibility to adverse
symptoms.
•	Take at least a 10 to 15 minute break every 30 minutes, even
if you don’t think you need it. Each person is different, so take
more frequent and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. You
should decide what works best for you.
•	It is normal for your headset to feel warm to the touch while in
use or while charging. Prolonged skin contact with a headset
that is hot to the touch may produce skin discomfort or redness,
or low temperature burns. If your headset feels hot to the touch
or is uncomfortably warm, stop using or charging it, and allow
it to cool down.
•
To prevent possible hearing damage, do not listen at high
volume levels for long periods.
System Alerts
For your protection, the headset will provide you with the
following alerts:
•	An audible and visual alert when the headset is overheating.
If that alert appears/sounds, to reduce the risk of personal
injury, immediately remove your headset and let it cool down
before continuing use.
•	A visual alert in the event of high volume levels. If that
alert appears, lower the sound volume to reduce the risk of
hearing loss.

Discomfort
•	Immediately discontinue using the headset if any of the
following symptoms are experienced: seizures; loss of
awareness; eye strain; eye or muscle twitching; involuntary
movements; altered, blurred, or double vision or other
visual abnormalities; dizziness; disorientation; impaired
balance; impaired hand-eye coordination; excessive sweating;
increased salivation; nausea; lightheadedness; discomfort
or pain in the head or eyes; drowsiness; fatigue; or any
symptoms similar to motion sickness.
•	Just as with the symptoms people can experience after they
disembark a cruise ship, symptoms of virtual reality exposure
can persist and become more apparent hours after use. These
post-use symptoms can include the symptoms above, as well
as excessive drowsiness and decreased ability to multi-task.
These symptoms may put you at an increased risk of injury
when engaging in normal activities in the real world.
•	Do not drive, operate
machinery, or engage
in other visually or
physically demanding
activities that have potentially serious consequences
(i.e., activities in which experiencing any symptoms could lead
to death, personal injury, or damage to property), or other
activities that require unimpaired balance and hand-eye
coordination (such as playing sports or riding a bicycle, etc.)
until you have fully recovered from any symptoms.
•	Do not use the headset until all symptoms have completely
subsided for several hours.
•	Be mindful of the type of content that you were using prior to
the onset of any symptoms because you may be more prone
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine

--- Page 13 ---
13
to symptoms based upon the content being used. Review the
comfort rating for the content you were using, and consider
using content with a more appropriate comfort rating.
•	See a doctor if you have serious and/or persistent symptoms.
Headset Battery and Charging
Your headset contains a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery and a
power adapter (charger) and charging cable. Improper use of the
battery or power adapter may result in a fire, explosion, battery
leakage or other hazard. Follow these instructions to reduce the
risk of injury to you or others, or damage to your product.
•	The battery in your headset is not user replaceable or
serviceable. Do not attempt to open your headset to access
the battery, open, repair or replace the battery. Please contact
Oculus Support, if you need battery or power management
support for your device.
•	Do not use or wear your headset while connected to the power
adapter or charging.
•	Only charge your headset with the included power adapter and
cable, or an approved power adapter and cable if not included.
Do not use other cables or power adapters. If you are unsure
about whether a cable or power adapter is compatible with
your headset, contact Oculus Support.
•	Periodically inspect connection cords, connector tips and the
power adapter for damage or signs of wear. Do not use your
power adapter if prong(s), enclosure, connector port, connector
cable or any part is damaged, cracked, or exposed.
•	Do not use external battery packs or power sources other than

on after attempted charging, if it gets abnormally warm when
it is used or charged, or if the battery compartment is swollen,
leaking liquid or smoking.
•	Do not disassemble, crush, bend or deform, puncture, shred or
put a high degree of pressure on the headset. This can cause
leakage or an internal short-circuit in the battery, resulting in
overheating.
•	Avoid dropping your headset. Dropping it, especially on a
hard surface, can potentially cause damage to the headset
and battery. If you suspect damage to your headset or battery,
contact Oculus Support.
•	Do not let your headset get wet or come in contact with liquids.
Even though the headset may dry and appear to operate
normally, the battery contacts or circuitry could slowly
corrode and pose a safety hazard. If the headset gets wet,
contact Oculus Support, even if the headset appears to be
working normally.
•	Do not place your headset in areas that may get very hot, such
as on or near a cooking surface, cooking appliance, iron or
radiator or in direct sunlight. Excessive heating can damage
the headset or the battery and could cause the headset or the
battery to explode. Do not dry a wet or damp headset with
an appliance or heat source such as a microwave oven, hair
dryer, iron or radiator. Avoid leaving your headset in a car in
high temperatures.
•	In the event of a battery leak, do not allow the liquid to come
in contact with the skin or eyes. If contact has been made,
wash the affected area with large amounts of water and seek
medical advice.

•	Always ensure that the headset has adequate ventilation
and air flow while in use or charging. Covering the headset
with materials that significantly affect air flow may affect its
performance and poses a possible risk of fire or explosion.
•	Your headset and power adapter (if provided) comply with
applicable limits for industry surface temperature standards. To
prevent potential low-temperature burns from prolonged direct
contact, avoid direct skin contact with your power adapter for
long periods of time when charging, or when plugged into a
power source. Ensure the power adapter is in a well-ventilated
area, when in use. Use the approved charging cable to optimize
proximity of your device to the adapter; do not place adapter
under a pillow, blanket or part of your body. Users with special
medical or physical conditions that impair the ability to detect
heat against your skin should take special care when using the
device or charging with the power adapter. Follow any thermal
warnings and advisory that may appear on your device’s screen.
•	Dispose of your headset and battery properly. Do not dispose
of the headset or battery in a fire or incinerator, as the battery
may explode when overheated. Dispose of separately from
household waste. Refer to www.oculus.com/support for proper
maintenance, replacement, and disposal of your headset.
Repetitive Stress Injury
