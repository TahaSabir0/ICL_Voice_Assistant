threads, and pull it to draw the new thread through
the machine, following the steps below.
*
Turn off the power switch before threading the
machine.
1. Pull the threads from the spools and draw them
through the thread guides, then tie the thread
ends together.
2. Raise the presser foot, draw the threads until the
knots are coming out from under the back of the
presser foot.
3. However, stop drawing the needle threads when
the knots reach just before the needle eye.
Cut the knots and thread the needle eye.
4. Before starting sewing, clear the needle threads
from under the presser foot to make sure they are
not caught below the needle plate.
(Draw the needle threads in the direction A)
Then pull out the threads to the back approxi-
mately 10 cm (4˝) away from the presser foot.

Starting Sewing
1. Insert the fabric under the toe of the foot.
(It is not necessary to raise the foot.)
2. Turn the handwheel gently toward you a couple
of turns and check the thread chain. Then start
sewing slowly.  The fabric will be automatically fed.
Guide the fabric in the desired direction.
 * For heavyweight fabric, raise the presser foot
and insert the fabric in front of the knife.
Then lower the foot and start to sew while guiding
the fabric.
Finishing Sewing
1. When stitching is completed, continue to run the
machine slowly to produce a thread chain for
about 12 cm (5´´) while pulling the thread chain
slightly to the back.
2. Cut the threads with the thread cutter as
illustrated, leaving about 5 cm (2´´) thread chain
from the end of the fabric.
1  Thread cutter
* The thread cutter becomes blunt as loose threads
build up. Remove the loose threads collected in
the thread cutter.
Sewing Continuously
Insert the next fabric under the toe of the foot, then
start sewing. It is not necessary to raise the presser
foot for ordinary fabric.
 * For heavyweight fabric, raise the presser foot
and insert the fabric in front of the knife.
Then lower the foot and start to sew while guiding
the fabric.
How to use Guide Lines
On the top of the looper cover are guide lines
indicating the distance from the needle position.
Please use them as sewing guides.
Mark L indicates the distance from the left needle.
Mark R indicates the distance from the right needle.
The distance between center of guide line and
needle position is 5/8 inch.

Securing Ends
To avoid unravelling, it is necessary to leave a
thread chain about 5 cm (2´´) long at the beginning
and at the end of a seam. To secure the beginning
and end of a seam choose one of the following
methods.
At the beginning
A. Separate the end of the threads and knot them.
B. Thread the chain through a large eyed needle,
and weave the chain through the overlock
stitches on the fabric.
C. Cut the chain at the edge of the fabric. Then
apply a small amount of seam sealant (Fray
CheckTM or Fray-No-MoreTM ) on the end of the
threads.
D. 1. Before putting your fabric in the machine, sew
a thread chain about 5 cm (2´´) long behind the
needle.
2. Put your fabric on the machine. Then serge a
few stitches and stop.
3. Raise the presser foot and bring the thread
chain to the left, around and under the presser
foot.
4. Place the thread chain between the presser
foot and upper knife, holding it in position as
you lower the presser foot to sew.
5. After sewing about 2.5 cm (1´´), move the chain
to the right and under the upper knife, cutting
the chain as you sew.
At the end of a seam
 * You can use the same methods as “At the
beginning” to secure the end of a seam except
“D” or you can use the methods shown below.
1. Serge one stitch off the end of a seam.
2. Raise the needle and presser foot, and gently pull
the threads off the chaining finger.
3. Turn the fabric over so that the under side is up.
4. Serge about 2.5 cm (1˝) over stitching and angle
off the fabric.
