Do not use the printer any way other than described here in order to avoid personal injury or property damage.
Do not place the printer near any heat source or ﬂammable or explosive objects. We suggest placing it in a well-ventilated, low-dust environment.
Do not expose the printer to violent vibration or any unstable environment, as this may cause poor print quality.
Before using experimental or exotic ﬁlaments, we suggest using standard ﬁlaments such as ABS or PLA to calibrate and test the machine.
Do not use any other power cable except the one supplied. Always use a grounded three-prong power outlet.
Do not wear gloves or loose clothing when operating the printer. Such cloths may become tangled in the printers moving parts leading to burns, possible bodily injury, or printer damage.
When cleaning debris from the printer hotend, always use the provided tools. Do not touch the nozzle directly when heated. This can cause personal injury.
Children under 10 years old should  not use the printer without supervision.

This machine is equipped with a security protection mechanism. Do not manually move the nozzle or printing platform mechanism manually while booting
up, otherwise the device will automatically power oﬀ for safety.
Clean the printer frequently. Always turn the power oﬀ when cleaning, and wipe with a dry cloth to remove dust, adhered printing plastics or any other material oﬀ the frame,
guide rails, or wheels. Use glass cleaner or isopropyl alcohol to clean the print surface.
Users should comply with the laws and regulations of the corresponding countries and regions where the equipment is located (used), abide by professional ethics, pay attention to
safety obligations, and strictly prohibit the use of our products or equipment for any illegal purposes. Creality will not be responsible for any violators' legal liability under any circustance.
Do not touch the nozzle, hotbed or motor while the printer is in operation, otherwise you may get burned.

Before switching on the machine, please check the tightness of the pulley by gently toggling it with your hand and check if it is idling
or stuck (as shown in Figure A).
If yes, please use an open-end spanner to adjust the hexagonal eccentric isolation column to make it rotate smoothly.

7.Auto Leveling
The above interface is for reference only.
7.1 Click on "Prepare → Auto Leveling" in the main interface, and then click on "Start" after the machine has returned home,
     and wait for the machine to detect the platform to ﬁnish the auto leveling.

--- Page 18 ---
13
7.Auto Leveling
The nozzle is too far away from the platform, so the ﬁlaments can not
adhere to the platform.
Filaments are extruded evenly, just sticking on the platform.
The nozzle is too close to the platform, leading to insuﬁcient ﬁlament
extrusion, even scraping the platform.
7.2 Click on "Move " in the settings screen, observe the height value of the Z-axis, set the value to 0 and then click on "Move "
     to return.
     Click on "Z-oﬀset" and observe the gap between the nozzle and the platform by adjusting the Z-axis compensation value
     so that the distance between the nozzle and the platform are about the thickness of a piece of an A4 paper.
0.08-0.1MM
7.3 Observe the print result after starting printing, and adjust the Z-axis compensation again if any exceptions occur.
The above interface is for reference only.

8.1.Preheating Method
A. Preheating mode 1: Click "Prepare" and select "Manual " to input corresponding values in the column of nozzle
temperature and hot bed temperature respectively.
B. Preheating mode 2: Click "Prepare" to select "Manual", select "PLA Preheat" or "ABS Preheat" according
 to the type of consumables, and click "More Preheat" for other types of consumables.
14
8.Filament Inﬁll
Note: The printing preheating parameter standard has been adjusted at the factory. PLA preheating standard: nozzle temperature 200 °,
hot bed temperature 60 °; ABS preheating standard: nozzle temperature 250 °, hot bed temperature 100 °. If adjustment is required due
to printing materials or other reasons, you can select "Preheat PLA" or "Preheat ABS" in "Tune - ADV.SET" to adjust the corresponding
temperature. Click "More preheat set" for the preheating temperature adjustment of other consumables.

8.2 Filament Inﬁll
8.Filament Inﬁll
A.When you wait for the temperature to rise, hang the ﬁlament over the material rack.
15
B.Pass through the Filament Sensor, then press the extruder handle and insert the ﬁlament along the extruder hole to the nozzle position.
If the ﬁlament ﬂows out of the nozzle when the temperature reaches the target value, the ﬁlament is properly loaded.
Replacement of ﬁlaments:
1.When the machine has just started printing, cut ﬁlaments near the extruder and slowly feed ﬁlaments until they are fed into the material barrel.
2.When printing has ﬁnished and the machine has cooled down, heat the nozzle to 185℃+, then draw the ﬁlaments out and replace them by
   referring to step 1.
3.To change the ﬁlaments during printing, adjust the printing speed to 10% and refer to step 2 for replacement.
For smooth insertion of the
ﬁlaments, the end position
of the ﬁlaments should be
handled as shown in the ﬁgure.

11.Routine Maintenance
11.1 Lubrication and maintenance
Tip: Please lubricate the guideways, sliders and screw rods in the blue area regularly (as shown in the ﬁgure). It is recommended to
do it once every 500 hours of printing.
1.
2.
3.
Tips:This hotbed can be heated up to 100°C. It is strictly forbidden to remove the printing platform when the temperature of the
hotbed is higher than 70°C. Since the printing platform is a wearing part, it is recommended to clean it regularly to ensure that the
ﬁrst layer of the model is adhered. Please replace it in time if it is damaged.
11.2 Use and maintenance of the magnetic adhesive sticker
Remove the printed model from
the machine together with the
platform and partially bend the
platform slightly to separate the
model from the platform.
ﬁlaments can be scraped oﬀ with
a blade included in the tool box.
Be cautious of safety when using
the blade.
When printing large models, it is recommended
to apply solid glue evenly on the surface of the
platform; if the platform is over-glued, it can be
cleaned with tap water and wipe the surface dry
afterwards.。

11.Routine Maintenance
11.3 Extruder kit maintenance
Tips:
22
Nozzle kit
Fan
Extruders are vulnerable parts. It is recommended to do the periodic inspection of extruder if it is used for more than three months
to check whether the fan has foreign objects on it or whether it is damaged, which will aﬀect the heat dissipation and cooling. If the
extrusion is uneven, intermittent and the printed model has no extrusion or has false layer, it is recommended to do the heat break
cleaning or replace the nozzle kit with a new one as a priority. Refer to the      nozzle kit.
