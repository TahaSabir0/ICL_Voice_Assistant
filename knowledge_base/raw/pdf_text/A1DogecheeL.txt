Thank you for purchasing this heat press from USCutter.  The following are important
things you need to know before you begin:
• Intended usage of this Heat Press: This heat press is designed to press heat transfer
vinyl (HTV), sublimation and transfer papers onto soft garments.
Do not attempt to set the temperature on this device at higher than 480 degrees
Fahrenheit as it will burn out the heating element.
Also avoid use of this heat press for other activities such as food preparation or extraction
of oils from plant materials and other alternative uses.
Use of this heat press in a manner other than intended will void the warranty, will damage
the machine, and may constitute a fire hazard.
• Preserve the shipping carton: Please do not discard or disassemble the carton this heat
press came in.  It was designed to hold the weight of this machine during shipping.
Should you need to return the equipment due to warranty or repair, you will need it. Do
not attempt to ship this equipment in a different container.
• Follow manufacturer instructions on materials  you press: Always use recommended
settings from the manufacturer for any material used in this press.  Those instructions are
usually always available on-line from the material maker.
Instructions on the most common and recommended materials are enclosed within this
documentation.
• Test before you press: We encourage you to always do a test of your fabric and HTV
or transfer paper together using a small sample of the materials before you do volume
production.
If possible your test should include actually washing and drying a pressed garment to
assure that the media has properly adhered to the garment using the heat and pressure
setting you have selected.
• Use extreme care during operation: Please also be careful as you operate the heat press.
During operation the platens will get hot enough to do serious injury to you should you
touch them, and surrounding metal parts will also reach high temperatures.
Please educate children and others around this equipment that it is not a toy and can
cause severe burns and/or injury if the unit is closed onto fingers or other body parts.
• Electrical Source: This heat press is designed for the North American market and is
designed to plug into a standard household 3 prong outlet.  (110-120V/60Hz.)  Do not
attempt to use this press with a two prong electrical cord or otherwise use it without
proper grounding.

clockwise decreases it.
The Time/Temperature Control Panel on the left upper face of the casing is where you will
set heat and time requirements of your project. These will vary depending on the vinyl or
transfer paper used.
The Control Arm opens & closes the top & bottom Heated Platens of the clamshell press.
The Reset Button is a breaker. It will pop out when there is an overload of electricity. Press
it in to reset.
The Power switch must be set to the on position and the Cord must be plugged in before
pressing.

How to calibrate your new Heat Press:
Instructions from manufacturers of heat transfer vinyls and transfer papers will instruct
you to use Low, Medium or High Pressure during the application process.  Here’s how to
calibrate your machine and identify those settings.  (Do this while the platens are cold.)
1.	 Turn the pressure knob counterclockwise a few times to lower pressure on the platens.
2.	 Place a piece of paper onto bottom of the platen
3.	 Close the clamshell press using the handle.
4.	 Pull on the paper.
5.	 If the paper moves at all, turn the knob clockwise and try again.
6.	 Try again and repeat until the paper doesn’t move at all.  This is your “Medium” pressure.
From the “Medium” setting, High pressure will be clockwise one to two turns.  Low pressure
will be counterclockwise one to two turns.  (The number of turns will depend the thickness
of the garment.
Note that using Medium and High pressure will make it just a bit difficult to close the heat
press.  During the pressing process, the goal is to press the heated material into the fibers
of the garment.
How to Calibrate the temperature of your new Heat Press:
On a new heat press, it is not unusual for the temperature settings to be off by 18 to 20
degrees.  To fix this, follow these simple steps:
1.	 Set the Heat Press temperature settings to 380F on the control panel. (See info
on this below)
2.	 When the press heats to about 100F, press the down arrow on the control panel
for 5 seconds.
The heat press will go into Calibration Mode.  It may take as long as 20 minutes to finish
this process.  Do not turn off or unplug the press during this time.  To ensure total accuracy,
you might also want to test the heat press using an Infrared Thermometer Gun. (available
at most hardware stores.)
Setting the Time and Temperature on your new Heat Press:
1.	 Using the control panel screen, press the “Set” button then the up or down arrow
to the desired temperature.
2.	 Press the Set button again and set the timer using the up and down arrows.
3.	 Press the Set button and arrows again to choose Fahrenheit or Celsius.
4.	 Press the Set button again to confirm these settings.
5.	 Press the Set button and use arrows one more time to set an alarm that will
notify you in advance when it is time to open the press.

How to press Heat Transfer Vinyl (HTV):
1.	 Use a vinyl cutter to cut your heat transfer vinyl material.  Remember that unless
otherwise instructed by the manufacturer, you will want to MIRROR the design so that
when it cuts, it appears backwards.
2.	 2)	Use a pair of scissors or cutting tool to trim around the image to make it a manageable
size.
3.	 Weed your design, removing the excess material. Remember to remove any material
inside cavity such as the inside of the letters O and A.  (Tip: If you heat up the material
using the bottom platen or your un-closed heat press for 2 to 3 seconds, it will be a lot
easier to weed most materials.)
4.	 Find the appropriate heating instructions for the material you are using either on-line
or in the chart in this manual, and set your heat press time and temperature using
manufacturer recommended settings.  (See info in this manual about setting your heat
press temperature and time.)
5.	 Use the Pressure Adjustment knob on the top of the press to adjust the pressure as
recommended. (See info on this manual about how to adjust pressure on your heat press.)
6.	 When  the heat press heats to the target temperature,  place your garment on the bottom
platen so that it is flat and there are no wrinkles in the material  Warning: The platens will
be very hot.  Be careful.
7.	 Pre-press the garment for 2 to 3 seconds to remove wrinkles and moisture.
8.	 Position the heat transfer vinyl on the shirt so that the colored vinyl on the liner is touching
the shirt. (Your design should appear through the liner un-mirrored.)
9.	 Lay a sheet of Teflon paper over the design to keep the top platen clean and avoid
scorching the surface of your heat transfer vinyl.
10.	Press the material at the time/temperature recommended by the manufacturer.
11.	 Open the press and remove the Teflon sheet. Set it aside as it can be re-used a limited
number of times.
12.	Next peel the liner sheet off the top of the garment based on manufacturer instructions.
Note:  After removing the garment, resist the urge to stretch, crumple or otherwise manipulate
the pressed garment until the material has had a chance to rest for 24 hours or so.  (The
chemical composition of the vinyl and adhesive are still reforming as the material cools.)
• Using Sure Cuts A Lot, this option will appear on your Cut Setting menu as a
click box.
• With  Vinyl Master, when you send your design to the cutter, you will find the
selection for the “Mirror” option in the Send to be Cut window.

Troubleshooting:
When I pressed my HTV, the material would not stick to the garment and/or fell off during
washing.  How do I fix this?
First double check manufacturer instructions – especially on heat and pressure settings.  If
you are following them to the letter, increase your pressure.  Remember:  Pressing isn’t just
about heating the vinyl – it’s about pushing the vinyl into the materials so that the adhesive
finds a grip.  Increasing the pressure is often the solution.
You might also need to increase your temperature a bit, but try this after you’ve increased
the pressure, and don’t up the temperature by more than about 5% over manufacturer
instructions.
When I peeled the carrier sheet from my HTV, the color vinyl came up off the garment but
the adhesive below it stayed in place.  What happened?
You are most likely peeling the material too hot.  HTV’s like metallic, printed/fashion, and
many others are usually recommended for cold peel.
If that’s not it, double check the garment you are pressing and make sure it’s appropriate
for the HTV  you are using.  If the material has a coating of any kind, you might need to use
a special HTV specifically designed for sticking to coated materials.  A common example of
this is someone trying to heat press HTV onto a water resistant fabric.  Using an HTV like
Siser Extra will solve the problem.
My Transfer paper is sticking to the heated platen. How do I fix this?
We really recommend the use of Teflon paper for most transfer pressings.  (In the case of
N0-Cut Fel form Forever Paper – use the supplied non-stick paper – not Teflon – which can
damage the flex material)
When I transfer, my colors look faded.
You need to increase the amount of time you’re pressing and/or increase the heat by 20
degrees.
My Heat Press won’t heat up.
Heat presses use a lot of energy while they are heating up.  It’s possible that the energy
drain has tripped the internal breaker in the press.  Use the reset button on the side of heat
press to reset it. If that doesn’t work, take a moment to plug something else into the wall
outlet you’re using for the press. It might be that you’ve tripped a circuit breaker.
Time/Temperature control panel shows “000”
If you see this, turn the machine off and back on.  If that doesn’t fix it, please contact our
support group as a replacement part might be necessary.

TIPS FOR YOUR HEAT PRESS
CLEANLINESS & PROTECTION
GARMENT SIZE
TIME
TEMPERATURE
PRESSURE
COLD/HOT PEEL
•The length of time your
heated press will be in
contact with the material.
•Heat transfer of a vinyl
design onto a garment
will usually take 10-15
seconds, while sublimation
onto a substrate can take
minutes.
•Many USCutter heat
presses have an auto-open
feature where the platen
will pop open after the
time expires, protecting
your material from
overexposure.
•Debris and plastic residue from
vinyl graphics can build up on the
platen if it’s not protected, which
can cause staining to affect whole
production runs.
•Use EZ Off Heat Press Platen
Cleaner to maintain a pristine heat
contact surface.
Keep a sense of scale in
mind. A graphic which
looks good on a men’s
extra-large might seem
overpowering on a
lady’s small. Fit the size
of your graphic to the
size of the material.
•Most heat transfer vinyls
require the temperature to
be set between 295° and
320°, while sublimation
occurs in a higher
temperature range of 350°
to 400°.
•Heat presses can be off
a few degrees, so do a
test press first with some
scraps of fabric and vinyl
to ensure your machine is
correctly calibrated.
•Usually the pressure
setting for your heat
platen must be manually
set with a knob.
•Most heat transfer
vinyls and sublimation
applications require
medium pressure. Some
textures like holographic
or glitter require firmer
pressure, but careful you
don’t leave the knob
cranked too much. This
can lead to damaged
equipment.
•Different heat transfer
vinyls require that you
remove the carrier sheet at
different points following
the heat press cycle.
•Many popular heat
transfer vinyls peel hot OR
cold.
•Some vinyls MUST be
peeled HOT, WARM, or
COLD though to ensure
the adhesives in the
carrier sheet and the
vinyl’s slower-setting
melt adhesive don’t work
against each other.
UPPER PLATEN
LOWER PLATEN
•Protect your garment from direct contact with the heat press
platens to prevent singeing.
•Teflon sheets or Hexis Filflex will protect your garment,
graphic, and platen.
