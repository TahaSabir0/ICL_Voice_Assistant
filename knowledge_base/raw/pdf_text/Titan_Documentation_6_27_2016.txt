What’s in the box
Where to use and store your vinyl Cutter
Location, Location, Location!  It’s not just important for real estate.  Where your vinyl
cutter “lives” in your home or business is a vitally important element of your success.
You need access to a 110 volt grounded electrical outlet.  That’s the standard
household kind with three holes, not two.  Be safe... don’t plug your cutter into
an already over-crowded powerstrip or system of extension cords.
Dust and dirt will limit the useful life of your cutter.  If you use it in a dusty or
dirty environment the cooling fans will suck in the dust and it will get inside
the machine and gum up the works.
Operate on a stable surface.  A solid flat surface is needed for your vinyl cutter
to do its best work.  If it wobbles or vibrates during operation your cut is not
going to be as sharp and clean as it could be.
Access is important.  This is a large machine, but it doesn’t belong in the corner
during use.  You’ll need to access the front and back of the cutter to operate it
and change the vinyl rolls.

Assembling the stand
Before you begin:
Read the assembly instructions from
beginning to end.  Give yourself plenty
of time.  Gather the tools you’ll need that
aren’t inluded in the box:

1.  6mm Allen Wrench

2.  Pliers, or a Crescent Wrench
Here’s how to assemble the stand:
Step 1.
Attach the feet (E) to the legs (F).
Attach the feet to the legs with 4 bolt sets
(2 sets per leg).  If they aren’t already
installed, screw in the rubber spacers
to the bottom of each ends of the feet.
Assembling the stand
The middle indentation of the leg should be
facing in.  The two outside indentations are
where we will attatch the crosspieces.

Step 2.
Attach the lower crossbrace to the leg (F)
using 2 bolt sets. Next, attach the upper
crosspiece
(B) and
media
roller
bracket
(D) to
the inner
and outer
portion of
the leg using these three bolts here.
Step 3.
Now, let’s mount the other leg assembly
by connecting the bottom crosspiece to the
adjascent holes and “floating” the upper
crossbrace in the adjascent slot.  Do not
attach the other side of the upper crosspiece
yet as we will need access to this portion for
the next step.
This is the foot:
This is the leg:
Notice: The
longer end
of the foot
offsets from
the side of
the leg that
has the two
highest
holes.
Longer End

The open hole is where we
will attach the catch roller
bracket in a later step.
Rubber Spacers:
Bolt Here:
Lower Crosspiece
Upper Crosspiece
Note:  The bottom crosspiece only attaches
with two bolt sets on each end despite
having four holes.  The extra holes are not
used.
Do not attach yet.

Step 5.
Install the Media Catch Roller Brackets so that the side
with the most distance from the holes is directly above
the Media Roller Brackets with the lip at the top and
facing out.
Use two bolt
sets per side
threading
one set
through the
Media Roller
Brackets,
Leg, and Top
Crosspiece.
Then set the
media catcher
poles and
basket into the rounded slots on each side.
Place the Titan Cutting module (A) on top of
the stand running the bolt threads, rubber
spacers,
and
washers
on the
bottom
of the
module
through
the holes on top of the leg mounts.  Make
sure the media rollers are on the same side
as the back of the module.  Connect using
the remaining four nuts.
Carefully set the media roller bars (H) inside
the previously installed media roller bracket,
and the uninstalled media roller bracket
while holding it next to the leg.  Run bolt
sets through the same holes of the media
roller bracket, leg, and top crosspiece as we
did on the other side with step 2 here.
Step 6.
Locate the grounding wire coming out
from behind the bottom of the left end cap.
Loosen the
bolt on the
outside of
the leg and
connect
the other
end of the
grounding
wire by
tightenning
the bolt
back into
the leg.
Step 7.
Longer side over media bars
Position back of the pinch rollers over media rollers.

Test Cut
Making Your First Test Cut
A Basic Guide To Vinyl Cutting
Now that you’ve got your system fully
assembled let’s take a moment to test it and
also take moment to learn a bit about how
to “fine tune” the machine so that it will do
quality cuts on the different materials you’ll be
cutting. To do this we’ll do a standard test cut,
which when competed will a simple triangle
inside of a square. Load the material roll and
adjust the pinch rollers.  Remember to make
sure the top roller is placed so that there is a
bottom roller (called the “grit roller”) beneath
it. Remember to line the material up so that it
is moving straight through the feed area, and
resist the temptation to run the material close
to the edge of the cutter feed area or you
increase the risk of a mis-feed that will wrinkle
your vinyl. (See the graphic on the top of pg.
21 for an example.)
Assuming you’re cutting standard signage
vinyl, you’ll want to use your 45° blade. If
you received vinyl along with your cutter
package, chances are very good it’s a standard
GreenStar or Oracal signage vinyl.  Now, find
the TEST button on the cutter control pad and
press it.  It should cut a pattern that looks like
this:
This Test Cut will help you to calibrate the
machine for this material. Examine this cut
and use a weeding tool or exacto knife to
weed the square out while keeping the
triangle on the paper. (“Weeding” is the word
for removing the cut vinyl in the design.)
Use this simple diagram to make adjustments.
There’s a certain amount of trial and error to it
at first, but you’ll quickly get a feel for it.

Troubleshooting
PROBLEM
SOLUTION
The cutter performs erratically
during cuts, stops cutting
before the cut is finished, or
cuts lines that do not appear in
the design.
Some computers do not work well when connected via the USB port of the
cutters. If you are having problems while cutting and are using the USB cable
to connect from your cutter to computer, you may wish to try the serial cable
connection to avoid further problems. If a serial cable connection is not available
on your computer, you can try a third party USB to serial connector or a PCI card
serial adapter for your computer.
After the first cut is made,
subsequent cuts are made over
the top of the original, or vinyl
is fed backwards until it loses
contact with the rollers.
After a cut is made, you will need to reset the origin of the cutter. If the origin is
not set again, the first origin will remain in the cutter and the cutter will return to
this position before making any further cuts. To reset the origin; from the main
screen of the cutter, press the Offline/Pause button on and then press the Origin
button.
Cuts are jagged or inconsistent.
The Blade may be dulled or damaged. Replace with a new blade and try again.
Make sure that the blade can turn freely (by attempting to turn it with your
fingers while the release button of the Blade Carriage is pressed).
Adjust the blade depth of the Blade Carriage (page 17) and Force setting on the
cutter (page 8) until you are getting solid, uniform cuts. Start with a blade depth
of around 1/64th of an inch and a pressure setting of 100g and try an increased
pressure setting before attempting to increase the blade depth.
Slashes are made across the
vinyl from the blade movement
during cutting.
If the blade is protruding too far from the Blade Carriage then it can score and
cut material during normal operations. If this is occurring, the blade needs to be
adjusted so that it is protruding a minimal distance from the carriage.
Vinyl not feeding straight and
the rightmost Pinch Roller will
not move.
Sometimes, during shipping or movement of the machine, the right pinch roller
will become stuck on a screw located on the back of the machine. If this occurs
and is affecting your cutting, press forcefully against the pinch roller until it
becomes dislodged from its position. If needed, remove the screw to reposition
the pinch roller in the desired position.
Cuts are warped and
inconsistent.
Sometimes,
during
shipping
or
movement
of
the
machine,
the
Carriage
Arm
can be dislodged from its track. Make sure that the 2 white wheels behind the
carriage arm are both resting securely on top of (not in front) of the track. If the
wheels are not on the track, gently lift the carriage arm and press back until both
wheels are resting on the track.

Maintenance For Your Cutter
Cutting Strips for your vinyl cutter will need
to be replaced periodically - we recommend it
be done every six months if you use your vinyl
cutter continuously.
You might need to change out your Cutting
Strips sooner if you start experiencing an uneven
depth of cut, or your material is peeling up even
on slow speeds.
To replace your Cutting Strip:

•
USCutter stocks replacement

cutting strips.  Go to

USCUTTER.com and search using

the keyword:  Cutting Strip.

•
Use a weeding tool or other pointed

tool to pry up the existing strip.

(For best results, start at either end

of the strip.)

•
Lay replacement into the channel

and use a heat gun or hair dryer to

heat the strip up as you squeeegee it

into place.

•
Use a knife to trim the ends of the

strip so that it fits in the channel.
Cutting Blades wear out with use and the
tips of the blades can snap just like the point of
a sharp pencil.  (This is particularly true of the
60 degree blade.)  You should also periodically
visibly inspect your blades and if you see visible
chips in the edge it’s best to replace the blade
with a new one.  (This is also a good time to wipe
away any vinyl debris that has built up inside the
blade holder.)
You might also consider the replacement of your
blade if you develop problems weeding or other-
wise experience problems with cut quality.
Refer to the manual section on Blade
Set-up for instructions on how to install re-
placement blades and remember to dispose of
your old blade safely by putting it in an alumi-
num can or other closed hard container.
