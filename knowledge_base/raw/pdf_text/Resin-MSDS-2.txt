4.First-aid Measures
Inhalation
Remove victim to fresh air immediately. Give oxygen or artificial respiration if needed. Seek
emergency medical attention.
Skin Contact
Remove contaminated clothing and wash with soap and clean water for 15 minutes at least. Seek

Fire fight from safe distance/ protected location with full protective clothing and self-contained
breathing apparatus. Water spray/ fog can be used for cooling.

6.Accidental Release Measures
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures
Wear suitable protective clothing. Extinguish all ignition sources, keep unnecessary people away,
ventilate area, and absorb spilled material with inert absorbent.

a well-vented area for preventing from inhalation. Keep away from heat source such as a heating
oven. Wash hands and exposed skin thoroughly after operation each time.
Conditions for safe storage
Avoid from light, strong oxidizers, strong acids and bases, radical initiators, heat, sparks, open
flame, or any sources of ignition. Must be stored in a cool(15-35oC/59-95oF) and dry place with
closed opaque containers. Do not blanket or mix with oxygen-free gas to prevent ineffectiveness of
polymerization inhibitors. Keep this product out of reach of kids and pets.

8.Exposure Controls/ Personal Protection
Respiratory Protection
NIOSH/ MSHA approved respiratory equipment is recommended.
Eye Protection
Tight-fitting chemical safety goggles and face shield should be equipped to avoid from any
splashing and vapor. Do not wear contact lenses for safety.
Skin Protection
Wear protective gloves(neoprene or nitrile), apron, boots, long pants, head and face protection,
prevent from any contact of skin. Equipment should be cleaned thoroughly after operation each time.
Engineering Controls
Ventilation system or outdoors for fresh air supply.
Other Hygienic Practices
Emergency eyewash and safety shower facility are well-prepared. Wash hands and shower
thoroughly after handling. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or any behavior unrelated to operation in

· 8.2 Exposure controls
Based on the composition shown in Section 3, the following measures are suggested for occupational safety
measure.
· Appropriate engineering controls:
Keep away from foodstuffs, beverages and feed.
Immediately remove all soiled and contaminated clothing
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of work.
Avoid contact with the eyes and skin.
See Section 7 for information about design of technical facilities.
· Personal protective equipment
· Respiratory protection:
In case of brief exposure or low pollution use respiratory filter device. In case of intensive or longer exposure
use self-contained respiratory protective device.
· Protection of hands:
Protective gloves
The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/ the substance/ the preparation.
Due to missing tests no recommendation to the glove material can be given for the product/ the preparation/
the chemical mixture.
Selection of the glove material on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and the
degradation.
· Material of gloves
The selection of the suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality
and varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. As the product is a preparation of several substances, the
resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the
application.
· Penetration time of glove material:
The exact break through time has to be found out by the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be
observed.
· Eye protection:
Tightly sealed goggles
· Environmental exposure controls:
Control measures must be made in accordance with Community environmental protection legislation.

Based on the composition shown in Section 3, the following measures are suggested for occupational safety
measure.
· Appropriate engineering controls:
Keep away from foodstuffs, beverages and feed.
Immediately remove all soiled and contaminated clothing
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of work.
Avoid contact with the eyes and skin.
See Section 7 for information about design of technical facilities.
· Personal protective equipment
· Respiratory protection:
In case of brief exposure or low pollution use respiratory filter device. In case of intensive or longer exposure
use self-contained respiratory protective device.
· Protection of hands:
Protective gloves
The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/ the substance/ the preparation.
Due to missing tests no recommendation to the glove material can be given for the product/ the preparation/
the chemical mixture.
Selection of the glove material on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and the
degradation.
· Material of gloves
The selection of the suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality
and varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. As the product is a preparation of several substances, the
resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the
application.
· Penetration time of glove material:
The exact break through time has to be found out by the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be
observed.
· Eye protection:
Tightly sealed goggles
· Environmental exposure controls:
Control measures must be made in accordance with Community environmental protection legislation.

SECTION 5: Firefighting measures

5.1.
Extinguishing media
Suitable extinguishing media
: carbon dioxide (CO2), powder, alcohol-resistant foam, water spray.
Unsuitable extinguishing media
: Strong water jet.

5.2.
Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Specific hazards
: Combustible. Heating will cause a rise in pressure with a risk of bursting.
Vapours are heavier than air and may travel considerable distance to an
ignition source and flash back to source of vapours. Can form explosive
mixture with air.
Hazardous decomposition products in
case of fire
: Carbon oxides (CO, CO2). Toxic fumes may be released.

5.3.
Advice for firefighters
Firefighting instructions
: Evacuate area. Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers. Contain
the extinguishing fluids by bunding. Prevent fire fighting water from entering
the environment.
Protection during firefighting
: Do not attempt to take action without suitable protective equipment. Self-
contained breathing apparatus.
Other information
: Do not allow run-off from fire-fighting to enter drains or water courses.
Dispose of waste in accordance with environmental legislation.
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures

6.1.
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
6.1.1.
For non-emergency personnel
For non-emergency personnel
: Evacuate unnecessary personnel. Keep upwind. Provide adequate ventilation.
Do not breathe vapours. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Wear
recommended personal protective equipment. Concerning personal protective
equipment to use, see section 8. Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks,
open flames and other ignition sources. No smoking. Ensure equipment is
adequately earthed. Use explosion-proof equipment. Use only non-sparking
tools.
6.1.2.
For emergency responders
For emergency responders
: Ensure procedures and training for emergency decontamination and disposal
are in place. Concerning personal protective equipment to use, see section 8.

6.2.
Environmental precautions
Do not allow to enter into surface water or drains. Notify authorities if product enters sewers or public waters.

6.3.
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Methods for cleaning up
: Stop leak if safe to do so. Dam up the liquid spill. Small quantities of liquid
spill: take up in non-combustible absorbent material and shovel into container
for disposal. Recover large spills by pumping (use an explosion proof or hand
pump). Place in a suitable container for disposal in accordance with the waste
regulations (see Section 13). This material and its container must be disposed
of in a safe way, and as per local legislation.

6.4.
Reference to other sections
Concerning personal protective equipment to use, see section 8. Concerning disposal elimination after cleaning, see

the incompatible materials listed in section 10. Bund storage facilities to
prevent soil and water pollution in the event of spillage. Take precautionary
measures against static discharge.
Heat and ignition sources
: Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open flames and other ignition
sources. No smoking. Protect from sunlight.
