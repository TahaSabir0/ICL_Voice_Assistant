1 Introduction
This manual is the designated user guide for the installation, setup, safe operation, and maintenance of your cabinet laser
engraver. It is divided into six chapters covering general information, safety instructions, installation steps, operation
instructions, maintenance procedures, and contact information.
ALL personnel involved in the installation, setup, operation, maintenance, and repair of this machine should read and
understand this manual, particularly its safety instructions. Some components are extremely high voltage and/or produce
powerful laser radiation. Substandard performance and longevity, property damage, and personal injury may result from
not knowing and following these instructions.
Your laser engraver works by emitting a powerful laser beam from a glass tube filled with insulating carbon dioxide
(CO₂), reflecting that beam off three mirrors and through a focus lens, and using this focused light to etch designs into
certain substrates. The first mirror is fixed near the end of the laser tube, the second mirror travels along the machine's Y
axis, and the third mirror is attached to the laser head that travels along the X axis. Because some dust from the engraving
process settles on the mirrors, they require frequent cleaning. Because they move during operation, they also require
periodic readjustment using their attached positioning screws to maintain the proper laser path. A water cooling
system—typically a pump or chiller—must be used with this engraver to dissipate the heat produced by the laser tube.
Similarly, an exhaust system—typically either an external vent or a dedicated air purifier–must be used to remove the
dust and gasses produced by the engraving process.
With low intensity use, the provided laser tube has an average lifespan around 2000 hours before requiring replacement.
However, constantly running your laser above 70% of its maximum rated power can significantly shorten its service life. It
is recommended to use settings from 10–70% of the maximum rated power to enjoy optimal performance and longevity.
Note that this is a high-voltage device and, as a safety precaution, it is recommended to only touch its components with
one hand at a time during use.
Note that the active laser is invisible to the human eye. This device should never be used while any cover is open to avoid
potentially permanent injury.
Note also that the cooling water system and exhaust system are both absolutely essential to the safe use of this device.
Never operate the engraver without both of these systems operating properly. Water should always be kept clean and
around room temperature, and the exhaust system should always comply with all applicable laws and regulations for
workplace and environmental air quality.

2.3 Laser Safety Instructions
When used as instructed, this machine comprises a Class 1 laser system safe for users and bystanders. However the
invisible engraving laser, the laser tube, and its electrical connections remain extremely dangerous. Used or modified
without care, they can cause serious property damage and personal injury including but not limited to the following:
•  The laser will easily burn nearby combustible materials
•  Some working materials may produce radiation or harmful gasses during processing
• Direct exposure to the laser will cause bodily harm including serious burns and irreperable
eye damage
As such,
•  DO NOT modify or disable this device's provided safety features. Do not modify or disassemble the laser and
do not use the laser if it has been modified or disassembled by anyone except trained and skilled professionals.
Dangerous radiation exposure and other injury may result from the use of adjusted, modified, or otherwise
incompatible equipment.
• NEVER leave any part of the cabinet open during operation except (when needed) the pass-through doors.
Never interfere with the laser beam, do not place any part of your body in any part of the laser path during
operation, and never attempt to view the laser directly. When using the pass-through doors or otherwise
risking exposure to the laser beam, take measures to protect yourself from potentially reflected laser beams
including the use of personal protective equipment such as protective eyewear specially designed to filter the
specific wavelength of your engraver's laser with an optical density (OD) of 5+.

3.1 Installation Overview
A complete working system consists of the laser engraving cabinet, its vent, a water tank (not included) with a pump
(included), all applicable connection cables, and the laser and access keys. The cabinet can use designs provided by the
inclosed engraving software by direct or internet connection with your computer; it can also engrave designs loaded
directly from a flash drive. Users can configure other additional accessories (such as an industrial water chiller, fume
extractor, or rotary axis) to suit their needs.
Use only the hardware, wiring, and power sources that came with or are compatible with this device.
Installing equipment that your device is not designed to work with can lead to poor performance,
shortened service time, increased maintenance costs, property damage, and personal injury.
Please note the specific requirements of your system's installation. Every customer must understand these notes before
installation to execute a proper setup and achieve safe laser performance. If you have any installation questions or
problems, contact our technicians and customer support team.
Any auxiliary equipment must be adjusted to the base machine. Queries may be directed to the dealer or manufacturer
of such equipment.
3.2 Location Selection
Before you install your engraver, select an appropriate location for its use.
Be sure that it meets all of the requirements discussed in the Safety Information above. The location should be stable,
level, dry, and climate controlled to ensure an ambient temperature of 40–75°F and an ambient humidity under 70%.  In
particular, the temperature and humidity together should not be close to the dew point. It is also advisible to use a
windowless room or to use blinds and/or curtains to avoid exposure to the potential additional heat of direct sunlight.
The location should be free of dust and other airborne pollutants and well ventilated enough to process any fumes
produced by the engraving process in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Depending on the
materials to be processed, this may require construction of a dedicated ventilation system. It should be away from
children; combustible, flammable, explosive, or corrosive materials; and sensitive EMI devices. The power cord
should be plugged into a compatible and stable power source via a grounded 3-prong outlet. No other item should
be drawing current from the same fuse. There should be fire-fighting equipment nearby and the local fire department's
phone number should be clearly displayed.
It is highly recommended to have an extra work table nearby in order to avoid placing objects on or directly adjacent to
the machine, which could become a fire or laser hazard.
3.3 Unpacking Your Engraver
Your engraving machine arrives in a wooden crate with its accessories (including this manual) packaged inside the
laser bay. You should have placed the crate in a spacious flat area for unpacking, ideally where you plan to operate the
machine permanently. If you have not already done so, finish removing the crate from around your engraver. Once
unpacked, the machine can be rolled into place.
Step 1.  Fix it in place by pressing down on the brake pads on the 2 front wheels.
Step 2.  Retrieve the access keys from the main bay in the front of the machine. Use them to unlock the laser bay in
the rear and take out the accessories pack. Check that you have received all of the following: a power cord, a
ground wire, USB and Ethernet cables, a USB flash drive with engraving software included, a water pump and
water piping, an exhaust pipe with a hose clamp, a set of hex wrenches, a tube of silicone sealant, an acrylic
focusing tool, a key, and this manual.

3.4 Electrical Grounding
This device employs a powerful laser. As discussed in the Safety Information above, it is extremely high voltage and
potentially dangerous, so users must securely ground it to avoid the buildup of static electricity. Using a standard
3-prong outlet will provide sufficient grounding. If you do not have access to a 3-prong outlet, you MUST use the
grounding cable and ensure its proper connection. The far end of the cable should be securely connected to a metal rod
driven at least 8 feet (3 m) deep into soil located at least 5 feet (1.5 m) from the machine. The resistance along the line
should be no greater than 5Ω.
Poor grounding WILL cause equipment failure and create a serious electrical shock hazard. The
manufacturer and/or seller bear(s) no responsibility and assume(s) no liability for any damage,
accidents, or injuries caused by bad grounding connections.
Step 3. CAREFULLY remove the rest of the foam packaging material from around the laser tube, the viewing
window, and the rest of the machine. The laser tube is a highly fragile object and should be handled delicately
and as little as possible.
Step 4.  Inside the main bay, remove the nylon cable ties from the X axis and the honeycomb table.
Step 5.  You may keep the packaging in case of future return but, if you dispose of it or any accessories, be sure to do
so in compliance with applicable waste disposal regulations.

3.5 Water Cooling Installation
The provided water pump is essential to your engraver's performance and longevity. When this laser works
without a properly maintained cooling system, its glass tube WILL explode from excess heat.
NEVER touch or adjust your engraver's water supply while the pump is connected to its power supply.
To install your pump, fill a dedicated tank with at least 2 gallons (7.5L) of distilled water. Using deionized or tap water
will gradually degrade the quality of your engraver and may even cause dangerous mineral buildup in the cooling
system. NEVER use antifreeze for the same reason. Store your engraver in a climate-controlled area that meets all the
requirements of the Safety Information and Location Selection sections above.
Connect the two hoses that came with your engraver to the water inlet (marked "Water IN") and water outlet (marked
"Water OUT") on the back of your engraver. Attach the other end of the inlet tube directly to your pump and completely
submerge the pump in your water tank. Place the outlet tube into the tank in such a way that the returning water flows
into the tank without splashing or other problems.
Connect the water pump to its power supply. For best results, use an power outlet on a separate fuse from the engraver
itself. If no such outlet is available, the pump can also be plugged into a dedicated socket located on the side of the
engraving cabinet. Once the pump is plugged in, water should begin to run through your machine and back into your
tank. ALWAYS obtain visual confirmation that the water is flowing through the laser tube before starting your laser.
NEVER allow the water in the tank to become too hot to cool the laser. Install a thermal alarm or periodically check the
water's temperature during prolonged use. If the water begins to reach 75°F (24°C), replace it with cooler water. Either
replace it in stages or turn off the laser during this process: never allow the laser to operate without a constant flow of
cooling water. It is also possible to add sealed bottles of frozen water to your tank to keep the water cool but never allow
the water to become ice cold itself, as this could shatter the heated glass CO₂ tube as well.
As an alternative to manually adjusting the water in your tank, you may also use an industrial water chiller to supply
temperature-controlled water to your machine. Follow its separate manual and again, for best results, plug it into a
separate fuse from the engraver itself. Remember to connect the chiller's outlet port with the engraver's inlet port and to
connect the chiller's inlet with the engraver's outlet.

--- Page 21 ---
17
3.6 Exhaust System
Install the provided exhaust pipe directly to the fan. The pipe can be expanded to a full length of about 5 feet (1.5 m).
The other end should be connected to a dedicated purifier or (if the fumes are not hazardous and meet local and national
air safety standards) placed out a window. NEVER operate the laser if the vent is not purifying or removing the fumes
produced by the target material. Research materials before use and never operate the laser on any (such as PVC, teflon,
and other halogen-containing substances) that can produce corrosive, hazardous, or even deadly fumes.
3.7 Main Power Connection
Confirm that the labeling beside the connection socket on the machine matches your power supply. Connect one end of
the main cable to the connection socket and the other end to a grounded outlet. Under NO circumstances should you
switch on the device if the voltages do not correspond.
Fluxuation along the line should be less than 5%. If this is exceeded, the fuses will blow. They are located in the
connection socket and are accessible from the exterior. Similarly, do not connect this device to standard extension cords
or power strips. Connect it directly to a grounded outlet or use a surge protector rated over 2000J.
3.8 Control Computer
See the software manual for details on the requirements for the control computer. The control computer can be connected
using the provided USB cable (via the port marked "PC"), using the provided Ethernet cable ("LAN"), or using the
internet if the engraver has been connected to it using the Ethernet cable. If the control computer is directly connected
to the engraver, it should not be placed more than 15 feet (4.5 m) away in order to avoid possible interference to the
signal on its line. Familiarize yourself with the software's image design features and laser control settings before using
it to operate the laser.

3.9 Initial Testing
Emergency Shutoff
Because of the risk of fire and other hazards during engraving, this engraver includes a large and easy-to-reach emergency
stop button near the control panel. Press it down to stop the laser tube instantly.
When your engraver arrives, its e-stop is already pressed and must be pulled up to allow the laser to function. You should
test that it works properly before conducting ANY other work with your machine. Start the water cooling system, place
a piece of laserable scrap material on the workbed, close the cover, and press PULSE to fire the laser. Hit the emergency
stop button and observe whether the laser stops instantly. If the laser continues to fire, the emergency stop is not working
and must be replaced before the engraver can be used. Turn off the machine and contact customer service.
Cover Shutoff (Interlock)
Because of the risk of blindness, burns, and other injury from direct exposure to the invisible engraving beam, this
device also shuts off the laser automatically when the protective cover is raised during operation.
After ensuring that the emergency stop button works, you should also test that the cover shutoff works properly before
conducting any other work on your machine. Start the water cooling system, place a piece of laserable scrap material on
the workbed, close the cover, and press PULSE to fire the laser. Release the button. Taking care not to expose yourself
to seeing or being hit by any possible reflected laser light, open the cover as little as possible and attempt to fire the laser
again. If the laser fires, the automatic shutoff is not working and must be repaired before the engraver can be used. Turn
off the machine and contact customer service.

--- Page 23 ---
19
Water Shutoff
Because of the danger posed by an uncooled laser tube, this engraver also shuts off the laser automatically when the
water cooling system malfunctions.
After ensuring that the emergency stop button and cover protection both work, you should also test that the water shutoff
works properly before conducting any other work on your machine. Start the water cooling system, place a piece of
laserable scrap material on the workbed, close the cover, and press PULSE to fire the laser. Release the button. Cut off
the flow of water by crimping or tying the two hoses. (Take care not to damage the hoses themselves in this procedure.)
Attempt to fire the laser again. If the laser fires, the automatic shutoff is not working and must be repaired before the
engraver can be used. Turn off the machine and contact customer service. If the laser does not fire, the automatic shutoff
is working fine; simply release the two hoses to begin circulating water again and continue setting up your engraver.
Laser Path Calibration
Although our factory calibrates your entire system during assembly, it is possible for the laser tube, the focus lens,
and/or one or more of the mirrors to be jostled out of alignment during shipment. As such, it is recommended that you
perform an optical alignment test as part of setting up your machine. See the Maintenance section below for step-by-step
guidance.
Air Assist
Your air assist should arrive pre-installed and correctly wired. Simply check that it is correctly configured and connected
as shown. If any tubing or wiring needs to be reconnected, shut off all power to the machine (including by pressing the
emergency stop) before adjusting anything.
3.10 Security
For your own safety and that of passersby, this engraver can be locked shut using the provided key. It is recommended
that you use it to lock the machine between sessions, preventing any unauthorized operation of the machine.

4.2 General Operation Instructions
Step 1. Create your design that you'd like to engrave. You can do this directly in your engraving software or use any
other graphics program, saving or converting the file to a format compatible with the engraver. See the full
list of acceptable file types in the Technical Specifications section above.
Step 2.  Check that your water tank is full of clean and cool but not cold distilled water. Replace the water if it is not
clean or cool. Add more water if it is not completely covering the water pump. Turn on the water pump by
plugging it in or (if it's plugged into the cabinet directly) by pulling up the emergency stop button and hitting
the water system switch on the side of the cabinet. Visually confirm that the water is flowing through the
whole system either by opening the top rear door to look at the laser tube itself or by observing that water is
entering the machine and returning to the tank through the outlet tube. If the laser tube is examined directly,
remember to close its access door before continuing. Add more distilled water if the pump is no longer well
covered after filling the engraver's water tubing.
Step 3.  Turn on your fume extractor or ventilation system, if any. (The engraver's own exhaust fan will turn on with
the machine.)
Step 4. Pull up the emergency stop button and turn on the engraver's control panel using its switch on the side of the cabinet.
Load your chosen design directly from a USB flash disk or through your computer's connection with the engraver.
Step 5.  Open the engraver's cover and adjust the workbed if necessary. The honeycomb bed is recommended for most
applications. The bed can be raised or lowered using the control panel or the manual adjustment knob to
accommodate different widths of different materials. Alternatively, the honeycomb bed can be removed to
expose the aluminum knife bed and provide a little more space for thicker projects. For heavier substrates, be
careful to distribute the weight as evenly as possible across the reinforced aluminum supports.
Step 6.  Place a sample piece of your material on the workbed. The standard location is in the top left corner of the
workbed. This can be changed by moving either your design or the location of the engraver's origin using
either the control panel or your engraving software.

To work on larger pieces of material, you may open the front or rear pass-through door or both together.
DO NOT insert anything onto the workbed through the pass-through doors other than the material
while the laser is active. Pay special attention to the fumes and dust that may be released through
these doors. Be sure that your ventilation system is strong enough to pull in all of byproducts or
wear the necessary PPE to ensure the health of users and passers by.
Step 7.  Focus the laser by using the control panel's autofocus feature or by placing the acrylic focus tool on top of the
material and carefully raising the workbed. The laser head should barely touch the top of the acrylic tool
without applying any pressure, ensuring the engraving distance is correct. (Again, never attempt to focus the
laser either way without some material on the workbed.) Close the cover.
Step 8.  Customize your design's contrast and engraving depth by adjusting the parameters in your engraving software
or directly through the control panel. If your engraving instructions detail the power setting in milliamperes,
use the following conversion chart to find the appropriate power setting:
4.1 Operation Overview

4.3 Instructions for Specific Materials
The following instructions are suggestions to help speed safe work with a range of materials. The user should research
the specific safety and engraving requirements of their specific material to avoid the risk of fire, hazardous dust,
corrosive and poisonous fumes, and other potential problems. Once the product is known to be safe or appropriate
protective equipment has been set up, it can be helpful to engrave a test matrix of small boxes produced at various speed
and power settings to discover the ideal settings for your design. Alternatively, start with low power and fast speed
settings and rerun your design as many times as needed, using progressively greater laser intensity.

The threshold for the lowest setting is 10%. The laser will not fire at any setting lower than this. It is NOT
recommended to use the laser tube at full capacity, especially for extended periods. The recommended
maximum power setting is 70%, as prolonged use above that amount will shorten your laser's service life.
To increase engraving depth, increase the amount of energy per unit area by increasing the laser's power
or the number or loops or by slowing down the speed parameter. Engraving too deep, however, reduces
image quality, especially for coated materials.

When working with new materials, remember that you should always start on the low end of likely settings. If
the effect is not yet strong enough, you can always rerun the design loop several times or rerun it with more
powerful settings until you create the effect that you want.

Resolution should usually be set to 500 dots per inch. Reducing your image resolution can be helpful in some
cases, reducing flaming and increasing the energy of the pulse in a way that improves the quality of the resultant
image in some materials such as some plastics.
Step 9. Turn on the laser tube by inserting and turning your laser key and by using its separate switch on the side of the cabinet.
To reduce the risk of electric shock, once the laser tube is on, try to touch the engraver with only one hand at a time.
Step 10.  Press START PAUSE to engrave your design. Again, do not stare continuously at the laser even through the
protective acrylic window. Watch for possible issues like sparks or fires, however, and be prepared to to
quickly extinguish a fire if necessary.
Step 11.  Once the laser has stopped, examine the quality of your first run and adjust the laser parameters on the
control panel or in your software as necessary to create the desired effect.
During repetitive engraving and cutting, periodically check your pump’s tank to maintain a water temperature
between 60–70°F (15–20°C).
Step 12.  When you have finished engraving, close your engraving software and then turn off your machine in the
following order: laser power supply, control panel, any ventilation device, the water cooling system, and the
emergency power button. Remove your laser key from the control panel.
Step 13.  Fully clean the workbed and empty the waste bin.
Step 14.  For best results, lock and disconnect your laser engraver from its power supply between uses. Unplug it or
turn off its intermediary surge protector.

Ceramics
When engraving on ceramics, generally use moderate to high power. Using more loops rather than higher power and
lower speed can help avoid cracking the material during work. Be mindful of the health risk posed by dust generated
from ceramic engraving, especially for repetitive industrial applications. Depending on the material and the amount of
work, a fan or even full ventilation system may be required to address the problem. Similarly, operators and others in
the work area may need to use breathing PPE such as masks and respirators.
Glass
When engraving glass, generally use high power and low speed. As with ceramics, it can be helpful to run more loops
at lower settings to avoid cracks. Care must be taken when engraving fiberglass and carbon fiber to avoid combinations
of settings that produce a laser intensity great enough to damage the structural integrity of its component fibers,
producing blurry marking. PPE should be worn to avoid exposure of the eyes, nose, mouth, and skin to the dust
produced by working with either material, especially for repetitive industrial applications. Clothing worn while work-
ing with fiberglass should be washed separately afterwards.

Thickness of Leather
Leather
When engraving leather products, generally use low to moderate power at high speed. Be especially attentive to the
possibility of fire, as well as the dust produced in repetitive applications.
Metal
CO₂ laser engravers should not be used for marking, engraving, or cutting metal. They are best suited for working
coatings applied to a metal base, and care must be taken not to attempt work on the underlying metal itself. A variety
of coatings specialized for CO₂ engraving are available, and the user should follow the instructions provided as the
parameters vary from product to product and metal to metal. Generally, work on aluminum coatings should be done
more quickly at lower power and work on steel coatings can be done more slowly at higher power.
Paper and Cardboard
When engraving various paper products, generally use low to moderate power and fast speed. Test samples from each
batch, as only small parameter differences can separate effects that are too light from those that burn through the
substrate. As with leather, be especially attentive of the possibility of fire, as well as the dust produced in repetitive
applications.
Plastics
Plastics for engraving are available in many different colors and thicknesses and with many different coatings and
surfaces. The majority of available plastics can be well engraved and cut with the laser. Plastics with a microporous
surface seem to give the best result, because less surface material needs to be removed. When engraving plastics,
generally use low power and high speed settings. Marking and engraving with too much power or at too low a speed
can concentrate too much energy at the point of contact, causing the plastic to melt. Among other problems, this may

--- Page 27 ---
23
produce poor engraving quality, noxious fumes, and even fires. High resolution engraving can cause the same problem,
so medium to low resolution designs should be preferred for most plastics.

Rubber
The various compositions and densities of rubber cause slightly varying engraving depth. Testing various settings on
sample pieces of your specific rubber is highly recommended for best results. When engraving rubber, generally use a
consistant high power setting and create your effects by varying the laser's speed. Microporous rubber materials require
a significantly higher speed than standard rubber. Engraving any kind of rubber produces a considerable amount of dust
and gas. Depending on the amount of work, breathing PPE and/or a full ventilation system may be required to address
the problem.
Stone
When engraving various kinds of stone, generally use moderate power and moderate to fast speed. As with ceramics and
glass, be mindful of the dust created (especially for repetitive industrial applications) and take similar measures to
ensure the safety of users and others in the work area.
Textiles
When engraving textiles like cloth and fleece, generally use low power and fast speed. As with leather, be especially
attentive to the possibility of fire and dust.
Wood
As with rubber, there is a huge variety of woods and testing your specific material is essential to get the best results. In
general, wood with consistant grain and coloring engraves more evenly. Knotted wood produces uneven effects, while
resinous wood produces greater edge contrast. Some soft woods like balsa, cork, and pine engrave well (albeit with low
contrast) at low or moderate power settings and high speed. Others like fir suffer from uneven fibers that usually
produce a poor effect no matter what you do. Hard woods like cherry and oak engrave well at high power settings and
low speed. Manufactured wood products can vary from brand to brand, mostly based on its glue composition and
ambundance. MDF works well but creates dark edges when cut.
In addition to the risk of fire with any wood product, extra care must be taken with the fumes from the glue used in
plywood and other manufactured woods. Some are too dangerous to work with at all, while others require careful
ventilation and the use of breathing PPE for repetitive industrial applications. Wood toxicity should also be examined,
as the dust from some natural woods including oleander and yew can also cause nausea and cardiac problems in high
enough amounts.

5.1 Maintenance Overview
The use of procedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous laser radiation exposure.
Before any cleaning or maintenance work, always switch off the device and disconnect it from its power supply.
Always keep the system clean, as flammable debris in the working and exhaust areas constitutes a fire hazard.
ONLY allow trained and skilled professionals to modify or disassemble this device.
5. Maintenance
•  Clean and cool water must be provided to the system at all times.
•  The working table must be cleaned and the waste bin emptied on a daily basis.
•  The 3rd mirror and the focus lens must be checked every day and cleaned if required.
•  The other mirrors and exhaust system must be checked every week and cleaned if required.
• The beam alignment should be checked weekly.
•  The wiring should be checked every week for loose connections, especially the wiring for the laser tube power supply.
•  The guide rails should be lubricated at least twice a month.
•  The air assist must be checked every month and cleaned if required.
•  The whole laser machine including the other components such as the water cooling system must be checked every
month and cleaned where required.
5.2 Water Cooling System
NEVER touch or adjust your engraver's water supply while the pump is still connected to its power supply.
The laser tube requires cool and clean distilled water to avoid overheating. Tepid water at room temperature or a little
below is ideal. The laser tube requires at least 2 gallons (7.5L) of cool and clean distilled water to avoid overheating. If the
temperature of the water ever approaches 75°F (24°C), discontinue work until it has cooled or find a way to reduce its
temperature without interrupting the supply of water to the laser tube. The water should never be allowed to become too
cold either, which could also cause the glass laser tube to shatter during use. During winter or if ice is used to cool hot
water, ensure the temperature never falls below 50°F (10°C).
More water should be added every few days to ensure evaporation does not cause the pump to become exposed during use.
5.3 Cleaning
5.3.1 Cleaning the Water System
NEVER touch or adjust your engraver's water supply while the pump is still connected to its power supply.
The water tank should be shielded from ambient dust created during work. If the water ever becomes visibly dirty,
discontinue work. The debris in the water will reduce its cooling efficiency, can heat up itself, and can damage the
cooling pipes. Change the water, place the water outlet tube into a separate bucket, and run the cooling system until all
contaminated water has been flushed from the engraver. Clean the water tank itself before refilling it with clean and cool
distilled water, replacing the outlet tube, and continuing operation.

--- Page 39 ---
35
If the water remains visibly clean at all times, it is still recommended that you clean the water tank about once a month as
a precaution, changing the water as you do so.
If you use an industrial water chiller instead of the provided pump, follow its separate instructions for maintenance but
similarly ensure that the water used remains cool, clean, and pure.
5.3.2 Cleaning the Main Bay and Engraver
Check at least once a day whether dust has accumulated in the main engraving bay. If so, it must be removed. The exact
cleaning interval and requirements strongly depend on the material being processed and the operating time of the device.
A clean machine guarantees optimal performance and reduces service costs, as well as reducing the risk of fire or injury.
Clean the viewing window with mild cleansers and a lens or cotton cloth. DO NOT use paper towels as they can scratch
the acrylic and reduce the cover's ability to protect you from laser radiation. Clean the interior of the main bay thoroughly,
removing any debris particles or deposits. Paper towels and window cleaner are recommended. When necessary, clean the
cover of the laser tube after it has been allowed to cool completely. Allow any fluid used in any cleaning to dry completely
before further use of the engraver.
5.3.3 Cleaning the Focus Lens
The lens has a durable coating and won't be damaged by correct and careful cleaning. You should check the lens and the
3rd mirror daily and clean them if there is any debris or haze on their surface. Your laser will be less efficient and heat
buildup on the oil or dust itself can damage the lens.
1.  Move the engraving table to a distance approximately 4″ (10 cm) under the lens holder.
2.  Move the laser head into the center of the workbed and put a cloth under the lens holder so that the lens will not

be damaged if it accidentally falls from its holder.
3.  Unscrew the lens holder, rotating to the left.

--- Page 40 ---
36
10.  Put the lens on a clean lens-cleaning tissue and put some lens-cleaning liquid on one side of the lens. Leave the
liquid to take effect for approximately one minute and then gently wipe it away with lens-cleaning tissues soaked
with lens-cleaning liquid. Dry this side of the lens with dry lens-cleaning tissues/cloth.
11.  Repeat the same cleaning process on the other side of the lens.
NEVER use a cleaning tissue twice. Dust accumulated in the cleaning tissue could scratch the lens surface.
12.  Examine the lens. If it is still dirty, repeat the cleaning process above until the lens is clean. Do not touch the surface
of the lens after cleaning.
13.  Carefully insert the lens into the lens holder, ensuring that its rounded convex side is facing upwards. Put the O-ring
on top of the lens.
14.  Carefully reassemble the lens and laser head attachments in reverse order.
4.  Remove the pressurized air hose and laser guide connections.
5.  Once positioned over your clean lens-cleaning tissue, remove the lens from the lens holder by carefully turning the
lens holder and letting the lens and its O-ring drop onto the cleaning cloth.
6.  Examine the O-ring and, if necessary, clean it with a cotton bud and a lens-cleaning tissue or cloth.
7.  Remove coarse dust as well as possible by blowing air onto the lens surface.
8.  Check the surface and if necessary clean the lens with the lens cleaning liquid and lens tissue or cloth.
9.  Hold the lens assembly by its edge with a lens-cleaning tissue and use a drop of lens-cleaning liquid. While holding
the lens at an angle, flush both surfaces to wash away grime.

5.3.4 Cleaning the Mirrors
The mirrors should be similarly cleaned if there is any debris or haze on their surface to improve performance and avoid
permanent damage. The 1st lens is located in the back left of the machine beyond the far end of the Y axis. The end of the
laser tube closest to this mirror is itself a semitransparent mirror that should be checked at the same time. The 2nd lens is
located on the Y axis at the left end of the X axis. The 3rd lens is located on top of the laser head on the X axis. The most
detritus accumulates on the 3rd mirror and it should be checked daily along with the focus lens. The laser tube and the 1st
and 2nd lenses can be checked daily if desired but are usually fine if they are only checked once a week.
The semitransparent mirror at the end of the laser tube should only be cleaned when the engraver is fully disconnected
from power and the tube is fully cooled. Clean all four mirrors with lens-cleaning tissue or with cotton wetted with
lens-cleaning liquid or isopropyl alcohol. The 3 positioning mirrors can be cleaned in place or removed for cleaning by
turning them counterclockwise. Take care not to touch the surface of any mirror directly. Clean with gentle circular
motions and avoid pressing hard enough to grind any debris or cause scratching. If any mirrors are removed for cleaning,
reinstall them by turning them into place clockwise while again being careful to avoid any scratching.
5.4 Laser Path Alignment
Having a proper beam alignment is important for the overall efficiency of the machine and quality of its work. This
machine went through a complete beam alignment before shipping. When the engraver first arrives and about once a week
during normal operation, however, it is recommended that users confirm that alignment is still at acceptable levels and
that the mirrors and focus lens have not shifted due to the movement of the machine.
You will need to place a piece of tape at each stage of the laser path, marking it to confirm that that stage remains correctly
aligned. When it is not, you will use the laser tube's brackets or the screws on the back of the misaligned mirror to correct
the problem. Once the provided tape runs out, we recommend masking tape as it is easy to manage and use.
Performing a beam alignment can expose the operator to small amounts of radiation if performed carelessly.
Please follow these procedures correctly and always take caution when performing a beam alignment.
Perform a beam alignment at low power levels: 15% or less. Any higher percentage will cause the laser to ignite
the testing tape instead of marking it. Be sure that you set the Max. Power (not Min.) to 15%.

--- Page 42 ---
38
DO NOT place the tape directly onto the mirror. Turn on the machine and set the power level to 15% or lower.
Press PULSE to manually fire the laser. You should be able to see a small mark on the tape. If it is not noticeable, press
PULSE again.
Pressing PULSE activates the laser. Always make sure the path is clear between the laser and its target. Never
allow foreign objects between the laser and its target. Take care not to leave any part of your body in the laser
path while pressing the PULSE button.
5.4.1 Laser Tube Alignment
To test the alignment of the laser tube with the 1st mirror, cut out a piece of tape and place it on the mirror's frame.
The laser mark should be near the center of the hole. If the laser is not centered on the 1st mirror, cut the power to your
laser and carefully adjust the laser tube on its brackets. This may require loosening the screws on its stand and adjusting
its brace wheel. Be careful not to over loosen the screws and not to overtighten them. Only adjust one stand at a time.
These marks are OK.
These marks require adjustment.
These marks are OK.
These marks require adjustment.

--- Page 43 ---
39
5.4.2 1st Mirror Alignment
After ensuring the laser is well aligned between the laser tube and 1st mirror, check the alignment between the 1st and
2nd mirrors. First, use the direction arrows on the control panel to send the 2nd mirror to the back of the bed along the
Y axis.
Once set, place a piece of tape on the 2nd mirror's frame. DO NOT place the tape directly onto the mirror. Repeat the steps
from §5.4.1. If the laser is not centered on the 2nd mirror, you will need to adjust the 1st mirror's set screws accordingly.
To adjust the mirror, loosen the nut on the screw and then slightly turn the screw either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Each screw adjusts a different position or angle. Keep track of which screw you are adjusting and the direction of
adjustment. Do not turn the screw more than ¼ turn at a time and, especially at first, test the position of the laser after each
adjustment so that you learn the effect of each change. Test until the beam is well aligned and then retighten the nuts on
the screws once all adjustments are completed.
Next, use the direction arrows on the control panel to send the 2nd mirror to the front of the bed along the Y axis.
Once set, place another piece of tape on the 2nd mirror's frame. DO NOT place the tape directly onto the mirror. Repeat
the steps from §5.4.1 and, if necessary, adjust the set screws on the 1st mirror. Test again until the beam is well aligned
and retighten the nuts on the set screws.

--- Page 44 ---
40-
5.4.3 2nd Mirror Alignment
After ensuring the laser is well aligned between the 1st and 2nd mirrors, check the alignment between the 2nd and 3rd
mirrors. Repeat the steps and adjustments above, taking care to use the tape on the mirror's frame and not its surface.
5.4.4 3rd Mirror Alignment
After ensuring the laser is well aligned between the 2nd and 3rd mirrors, check the alignment between the 3rd mirror
and the workbed. First, unplug the air assist hose from the laser head. Then, place a piece of tape across the bottom of
the laser head and press it onto the nozzle with some force. This will leave a ring mark that can help you check the
accuracy. Repeat the steps from §5.4.1. If the laser is not centered through the laser head, adjust the 3rd mirror's set
screws accordingly as in §5.4.2. Test again until the beam is well aligned and retighten the nuts on the set screws.
When the laser is well centered along the entire path from the tube to the workbed, your laser mirrors are all correctly
calibrated and (assuming they are clean) performing at optimum efficiency.
5.5 Lubrication
It is recommended that you add white lithium grease to the X and Y axis guide rails and Z axis screws at least once every
two weeks.

--- Page 45 ---
5.6 Parts Replacement
The engraver should not be modified or disassembled by anyone except trained and skilled professionals, but some
consumable parts may require replacement after prolonged use. Be sure only to use identical or compatible replacement
parts with this engraver. Contact your vendor or our technicians if you have any questions about fitment. Using incompatible
components is highly dangerous and waives all the manufacturer's liability for any damage or injury caused.
ALWAYS completely disconnect the engraver from its power supply before replacing any parts.
41
Take special care when replacing the laser tube or its power supply, as both have extremely high voltage connections. If
you replace the power supply with an identical model, you will be able to use the same screw terminal blocks as a unit. If
you change to a different laser power supply, refer to the following diagram:
FG: Ground Wire for the Mains and Case
AC₁: Neutral Wire to the Main Power
AC₂: Live Input from the Main Power
H: Connection for Active-High Devices (like this machine)
