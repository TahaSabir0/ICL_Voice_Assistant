IMPORTANT PRINTER CHANGES!
All of the printers in the lab have been upgraded!!
Glue or hairspray is no longer needed for the print bed
Bed leveling is now automatic
The beds are magnetic, to remove your print simply lift off the bed and gently flex until your print pops off
Fill out the dry erase board in front of the printer you are using with your contact info, that way if anyone is in
 the lab and notices a problem with your print they can notify you if you are in the lab and notice a print is
failing send the user an email
